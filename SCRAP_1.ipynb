Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. And she explains the whole story from departure until the death of Titanic on its first and last voyage April 15th, 1912 at 2:20 in the morning.</p>\n",

      "<br>Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.\n",
      "<br>She's a goddamn liar!\n",

      "<br>God only knows why.\n",
      "Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.\n",
      "<br>They're inbound!\n",
      "<br>Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the\n",
      "Titanic when she was 17, right?\n",
      "<br>- That's right.\n",
      "- If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.\n",
      "<br>101 next month.\n",
      "<br>Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.\n",
      "<br>Look, I've already done the\n",
      "background on this woman...\n",
      "<br>...all the way back to the 20s,\n",
      "when she was working as an actress.\n",
      "<br>An actress.\n",
      "There's your first clue, Sherlock.\n",
      "<br>Her name was Rose Dawson back then.\n",
      "Then she marries this guy named Calvert.\n",
      "<br>They move to Cedar Rapids\n",
      "and she punches out a couple of kids.\n",
      "<br>Now Calvert's dead\n",
      "and, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.\n",
      "<br>And everybody who knows about the\n",
      "diamond is supposed to be dead...\n",
      "<br>...or on this boat,\n",
      "but she knows.\n",
      "<br>Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?\n",
      "<br>Hurry up, give him a hand.\n",
      "<br>Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.\n",
      "Welcome to the Keldysh.\n",

      "<br>We met just a few\n",

      "<br>Remember, Nana?\n",
      "Up on deck?\n",
      "<br>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br>There. That's nice.\n",
      "<br>Have to have my\n",
      "pictures when I travel.\n",
      "<br>Can I get you anything?\n",
      "<br>Is there anything you'd like?\n",
      "<br>Yes.\n",
      "<br>I would like to\n",
      "see my drawing.\n",
      "<br>Louis XVI wore a fabulous\n",
      "stone that was...\n",
      "<br>...called the Blue Diamond\n",
      "of the Crown...\n",
      "<br>...which disappeared\n",
      "in 1792...\n",
      "<br>...about the same time old Louis lost\n",
      "everything from the neck up.\n",
      "<br>The theory goes that the\n",
      "crown diamond was chopped, too.\n",
      "<br>Recut into a heart-like shape that\n",
      "became known as...\n",
      "<br>...the Heart of the Ocean.\n",
      "<br>Today it would be worth\n",
      "more than the Hope diamond.\n",
      "<br>It was a dreadful,\n",
      "heavy thing.\n",
      "<br>I only wore it this once.\n",
      "<br>You actually think\n",
      "this is you, Nana?\n",
      "<br>It is me, dear.\n",
      "<br>Wasn't I a dish?\n",
      "<br>I tracked it down\n",
      "through insurance records.\n",
      "<br>An old claim that was settled\n",
      "under terms of absolute secrecy.\n",
      "<br>Can you tell me who the\n",
      "claimant was, Rose?\n",
      "<br>I should imagine someone\n",
      "named Hockley.\n",
      "<br>Nathan Hockley,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "<br>Pittsburgh steel tycoon.\n",
      "<br>The claim was for a\n",
      "diamond necklace his son...\n",
      "<br>...Caledon, bought his fiancée.\n",
      "<br>You.\n",
      "<br>A week before he\n",
      "sailed on Titanic.\n",
      "<br>And it was filed right\n",
      "after the sinking.\n",
      "<br>So the diamond had to have\n",
      "gone down with the ship.\n",
      "<br>You see the date?\n",
      "<br>April 14, 1912\n",
      "<br>Which means if your grandmother\n",
      "is who she says she is...\n",
      "<br>...she was wearing the diamond\n",
      "the day the Titanic sank.\n",
      "<br>And that makes you\n",
      "my new best friend.\n",
      "<br>These are some of the things\n",
      "we recovered from your stateroom.\n",
      "<br>This was mine.\n",
      "<br>How extraordinary.\n",
      "<br>And it looks the same as it\n",
      "did the last time I saw it.\n",
      "<br>The reflection has\n",
      "changed a bit.\n",
      "<br>Are you ready to go\n",
      "back to Titanic?\n",
      "<br>Okay, here we go.\n",
      "<br>She hits the berg on\n",
      "the starboard side, right?\n",
      "<br>She kind of bumps along...\n",
      "<br>...punching holes like\n",
      "morse code...\n",
      "<br>-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...\n",
      "<br>...below the waterline.\n",
      "<br>Then the forward compartments\n",
      "start to flood.\n",
      "<br>Now, as the water\n",
      "level rises...\n",
      "<br>...it spills over the\n",
      "watertight bulkheads...\n",
      "<br>which, unfortunately, don't go\n",

      "<br>...then faster and faster...\n",
      "<br>...until finally, she's got her whole\n",
      "ass sticking up in the air.\n",
      "<br>And that's a big ass.\n",
      "<br>We're talking\n",
      "20, 30,000 tons. Okay?\n",
      "<br>And the hull's not designed\n",
      "to deal with that pressure.\n",
      "<br>So, what happens?\n",
      "<br>She splits, right\n",
      "down to the keel.\n",
      "<br>And the stern...\n",
      "<br>...falls back level.\n",
      "<br>Then...\n",
      "<br>...as the bow sinks...\n",
      "<br>...it pulls the stern vertical...\n",
      "<br>...and then finally detaches.\n",
      "<br>Now the stern section just kind of bobs\n",
      "there like a cork for a couple of minutes...\n",
      "<br>...floods, and finally goes\n",
      "under about 2:20 AM...\n",
      "<br>...2 hours and 40 minutes\n",
      "after the collision.\n",
      "<br>The bow section\n",
      "planes away...\n",
      "<br>...landing about a\n",
      "half a mile away...\n",
      "<br>...going 20, 30 knots when\n",
      "it hits the ocean floor.\n",
      "<br>Pretty cool, huh?\n",
      "<br>Thank you for that fine\n",
      "forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.\n",

      "<br>Come on.\n",
      "<br>That's right.\n",
      "<br>You can do it.\n",
      "<br>I got you.\n",
      "<br>What's all this?\n",
      "<br>You stand back and...\n",
      "<br>...don't move an inch!\n",
      "<br>Fetch the Master at Arms.\n",
      "<br>This is completely unacceptable!\n",
      "<br>What made you think that you could\n",
      "put your hands on my fiancée?!\n",
      "<br>Look at me, you filth!\n",
      "<br>Cal.\n",
      "<br>What do you think\n",
      "you were doing?\n",
      "<br>Cal, stop.\n",
      "It was an accident.\n",
      "<br>An accident?\n",
      "<br>It was.\n",
      "<br>Stupid, really.\n",
      "<br>I was leaning over and I slipped.\n",
      "<br>I was leaning far over\n",
      "to see the, uh...\n",
      "<br>...uh, uh, the uh...\n",
      "<br>- Propellers?\n",
      "- Propellers, and I slipped.\n",
      "<br>And I would have gone\n",
      "overboard but Mr. Dawson here...\n",
      "<br>...saved me. And almost\n",
      "went over himself.\n",
      "<br>You wanted to see the...\n",
      "She wanted to see the propellers.\n",
      "<br>Like I said, women and\n",
      "machinery do not mix.\n",
      "<br>Was that the way of it?\n",
      "<br>Yeah. Yeah, that\n",
      "was pretty much it.\n",
      "<br>Well, the boy's a hero then.\n",
      "<br>Good for you, son.\n",
      "Well done.\n",
      "<br>So, it's all's well and back\n",
      "to our brandy, eh?\n",
      "<br>Look at you. You must be freezing.\n",
      "Let's get you inside.\n",
      "<br>Perhaps a little something\n",
      "for the boy?\n",
      "<br>Of course.\n",
      "<br>Mr. Lovejoy,\n",
      "I think a 20 should do it.\n",
      "<br>Is that the going rate\n",
      "for saving the woman you love?\n",
      "<br>Rose is displeased.\n",
      "<br>What to do?\n",
      "<br>I know.\n",
      "<br>Perhaps you could join us for\n",
      "dinner tomorrow evening...\n",
      "<br>...to regale our group...\n",
      "<br>...with your heroic tale.\n",
      "<br>Sure.\n",
      "Count me in.\n",
      "<br>Good.\n",
      "It's settled then.\n",
      "<br>This should be interesting.\n",
      "<br>Can I bum a smoke?\n",
      "<br>You'll want to tie those.\n",
      "<br>It's interesting...\n",
      "<br>...the young lady slipped\n",
      "so suddenly...\n",
      "<br>...and you still had time to remove\n",
      "your jacket and your shoes.\n",
      "<br>I know you've been melancholy.\n",
      "<br>I don't pretend to know why.\n",
      "<br>I intended to save this...\n",
      "<br>...until the engagement\n",
      "gala next week...\n",
      "<br>...but, I thought...\n",
      "<br>...tonight.\n",
      "<br>Good gracious.\n",
      "<br>Perhaps as a reminder\n",
      "of my feelings for you.\n",
      "<br>- Is it a--\n",
      "- Diamond. Yes.\n",
      "<br>56 carats to be exact.\n",
      "<br>It was worn by Louis XVI.\n",
      "<br>And they called\n",
      "it Le Coeur de Ia Mer.\n",
      "<br>- The Heart of the Ocean.\n",
      "- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.\n",
      "<br>It's overwhelming.\n",
      "<br>Well, it's for royalty.\n",
      "<br>We are royalty, Rose.\n",
      "<br>You know, there's\n",
      "nothing I couldn't give you.\n",
      "<br>There's nothing I'd deny you...\n",
      "<br>...if you would not deny me.\n",
      "<br>Open your heart to me, Rose.\n",
      "<br>Well, I've been on my own since\n",
      "I was 15, since my folks died.\n",
      "<br>And I had no brothers or sisters or\n",
      "close kin in that part of the country...\n",
      "<br>...so I lit on out of there and I\n",
      "haven't been back since.\n",
      "<br>You could just call me a\n",
      "tumbleweed blowing in the wind.\n",
      "<br>Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile\n",
      "around this boat deck and...\n",
      "<br>...chewed over how great the weather's\n",
      "been and how I grew up...\n",
      "<br>...but I reckon that's not why\n",
      "you came to talk to me, is it?\n",
      "<br>- Mr. Dawson, I--\n",
      "- Jack.\n",
      "<br>Jack.\n",
      "<br>I want to thank you\n",
      "for what you did.\n",
      "<br>Not just for pulling me back,\n",
      "but for your discretion.\n",
      "<br>You're welcome.\n",
      "<br>Look.\n",
      "<br>I know what you\n",
      "must be thinking.\n",
      "<br>Poor little rich girl.\n",
      "<br>What does she know about misery?\n",
      "<br>No.\n",
      "<br>No, that's not what I was thinking.\n",
      "<br>What I was thinking was...\n",
      "<br>---what could have happened to this girl\n",
      "to make her think she had no way out?\n",
      "<br>Well I...\n",
      "<br>It was everything.\n",
      "It was my whole world and...\n",
      "<br>...all the people in it.\n",
      "<br>And the inertia of my life,\n",
      "plunging ahead and me...\n",
      "<br>...powerless to stop it.\n",
      "<br>God,\n",
      "look at that thing.\n",
      "<br>You would have gone\n",
      "straight to the bottom.\n",
      "<br>500 invitations have gone out.\n",
      "<br>All of Philadelphia society will be there.\n",
      "<br>And all the while I feel I'm...\n",
      "<br>...standing in the middle\n",
      "of a crowded room...\n",
      "<br>...screaming at the\n",
      "top of my lungs...\n",
      "<br>...and no one\n",
      "even looks up.\n",
      "<br>Do you love him?\n",
      "<br>Pardon me?\n",
      "<br>Do you love him?\n",
      "<br>You're being very rude. You\n",
      "shouldn't be asking me this.\n",
      "<br>Well, it's a simple question.\n",
      "Do you love the guy or not?\n",
      "<br>This is not a suitable conversation.\n",
      "<br>VVhy can't you just\n",
      "answer the question?\n",
      "<br>This is absurd.\n",
      "<br>You don't know me\n",
      "and I don't know you...\n",
      "<br>...and we are not having this\n",
      "conversation at all. You are rude...\n",
      "<br>...and uncouth and presumptuous\n",
      "and I am leaving now...\n",
      "<br>...Jack. Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "It's been a pleasure.\n",
      "<br>I sought you out to thank you\n",
      "and now I have thanked you.\n",
      "<br>And you've insulted me.\n",
      "<br>Well, you deserved it.\n",
      "<br>- Right.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "<br>I thought you were leaving.\n",
      "<br>I am.\n",
      "<br>You are so annoying.\n",
      "<br>Wait.\n",
      "<br>I don't have to leave. This is\n",
      "my part of the ship. You leave.\n",
      "<br>Well, well, well.\n",
      "Now who's being rude?\n",
      "<br>What is this stupid thing\n",
      "you're carrying around?\n",
      "<br>So, what are you,\n",
      "an artist or something?\n",
      "<br>These are rather good.\n",
      "<br>They're very good, actually.\n",
      "<br>Jack, this is exquisite work.\n",
      "<br>Ah, they didn't think too\n",
      "much of them in old Paree.\n",
      "<br>Paris?\n",
      "<br>You do get around\n",
      "for a p--\n",
      "<br>Well, a-- a\n",
      "person of limited means.\n",
      "<br>Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.\n",
      "<br>Well, well, well.\n",
      "<br>And these were drawn from life?\n",
      "<br>Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.\n",
      "<br>Lots of girls are willing\n",
      "to take their clothes off.\n",
      "<br>You liked this woman.\n",
      "<br>You used her several times.\n",
      "<br>Well.\n",
      "<br>She had beautiful\n",
      "hands, you see?\n",
      "<br>I think you must have\n",
      "had a love affair with her.\n",
      "<br>No, no, no.\n",
      "Just with her hands.\n",
      "<br>She was a\n",
      "one-legged prostitute.\n",
      "<br>See?\n",
      "<br>She had a good\n",
      "sense of humor though.\n",
      "<br>Oh, and this lady...\n",
      "<br>She used to sit at this bar every night...\n",
      "<br>...wearing every piece\n",
      "of jewelry she owned...\n",
      "<br>...just waiting for\n",
      "her long, lost love.\n",
      "<br>We called her Madame Bijoux.\n",
      "<br>See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.\n",
      "<br>Well,\n",
      "you have a gift, Jack.\n",
      "<br>You do.\n",
      "<br>You see people.\n",
      "<br>I see you.\n",
      "<br>And?\n",
      "<br>You wouldn't have jumped.\n",
      "<br>But the purpose of university\n",
      "is to find a suitable husband.\n",
      "<br>Rose has already done that.\n",
      "<br>Look, here comes that\n",
      "vulgar Brown woman.\n",
      "<br>Quickly, get up before\n",
      "she sits with us.\n",
      "<br>Hello, girls. I was hoping\n",
      "I'd catch you at tea.\n",
      "<br>We're awfully sorry,\n",
      "you missed it.\n",
      "<br>The Countess and I were just\n",
      "off to take the air on the boat deck.\n",
      "<br>What a lovely idea.\n",
      "I need to catch up on my gossip.\n",
      "<br>Countess.\n",
      "<br>So, you've not yet lit the\n",
      "last four boilers?\n",
      "<br>No, I don't see\n",
      "the need.\n",
      "<br>We are making excellent time.\n",
      "<br>The press knows the size of Titanic.\n",
      "Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.\n",
      "<br>We must give them\n",
      "something new to print.\n",
      "<br>This maiden voyage\n",
      "of Titanic must...\n",
      "<br>...make headlines.\n",
      "<br>Mr. lsmay, I would prefer\n",
      "not to push the engines...\n",
      "<br>...until they've been properly run in.\n",
      "<br>Of course I'm just a passenger.\n",
      "<br>I leave it to your good offices\n",
      "to decide what's best.\n",
      "<br>But what a glorious end to your final crossing...\n",
      "<br>...if we were to get into New York\n",
      "on Tuesday night...\n",
      "<br>...and surprise them all.\n",
      "Make the morning papers.\n",
      "<br>Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?\n",
      "<br>Good man.\n",
      "<br>After that, I worked\n",
      "on a squid boat in Monterey...\n",
      "<br>...then I went to Los Angeles to the...\n",
      "<br>...Santa Monica pier\n",
      "and did portraits for 10 cents each.\n",
      "<br>Why can't I be like you?\n",
      "<br>Just head out for the horizon\n",
      "whenever I feel like it.\n",
      "<br>Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...\n",
      "<br>only if we just talk about it\n",
      "<br>No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.\n",
      "<br>Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up\n",
      "<br>We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.\n",
      "<br>But you have to do it like a real cowboy.\n",
      "No sidesaddle stuff.\n",
      "<br>You mean with one leg on each side?\n",
      "<br>Can you show me?\n",
      "<br>Sure, if you like.\n",
      "<br>Teach me to ride like a man.\n",
      "<br>Chew tobacco like a man.\n",
      "<br>And spit like a man.\n",
      "<br>You didn't learn in finishing school?\n",
      "<br>No.\n",
      "<br>Come on, I'll show you.\n",
      "<br>I'll show you how.\n",
      "<br>Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.\n",
      "<br>I couldn't possibly, Jack.\n",
      "<br>Watch closely.\n",
      "<br>That's disgusting.\n",
      "<br>Your turn\n",
      "<br>That was pitiful.\n",
      "You really have to hawk it back.\n",
      "<br>Get some leverage.\n",
      "Use your arms. Arc your neck.\n",
      "<br>You see the range on that thing?\n",
      "<br>Okay, go.\n",
      "<br>That was better. You have to work on it.\n",
      "Really try to hawk it up.\n",
      "<br>Mother.\n",
      "<br>May I introduce Jack Dawson?\n",
      "<br>Charmed, I'm sure.\n",
      "<br>The others were gracious and curious\n",
      "about the man who'd saved my life.\n",
      "<br>But my mother looked at him like an insect.\n",
      "<br>A dangerous insect\n",
      "which must be squashed quickly.\n",
      "<br>Sounds like you're a good man\n",
      "to have around in a sticky spot.\n",
      "<br>Why do they always insist on announcing\n",
      "dinner like a damn cavalry charge?\n",
      "<br>Shall we go dress, Mother?\n",
      "<br>See you at dinner, Jack.\n",
      "<br>Uh, son?\n",
      "<br>Son!\n",
      "<br>Do you have any idea what you're doing?\n",
      "<br>Not really.\n",
      "<br>You're about to go into the snake pit.\n",
      "<br>What are you going to wear?\n",
      "<br>I figured. Come on.\n",
      "<br>I was right. You and my son\n",
      "are just about the same size.\n",
      "<br>Pretty close.\n",
      "<br>You shine up like a new penny.\n",
      "<br>Good evening, sir.\n",
      "<br>Thousands of tons of Hockley steel\n",
      "are in this ship.\n",
      "<br>- Which part?\n",
      "- All the right ones.\n",
      "<br>Then you're accountable\n",
      "if there's a problem. Where's Rose?\n",
      "<br>She'll be along.\n",
      "<br>There is the Countess.\n",
      "<br>I saw that in a nickelodeon\n",
      "and always wanted to do it.\n",
      "<br>Darling...\n",
      "<br>...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "<br>It's amazing.\n",
      "You could almost pass for a gentleman.\n",
      "<br>Almost.\n",
      "<br>This is extraordinary.\n",
      "<br>This is a remarkable voyage.\n",
      "<br>- Mad.\n",
      "- Completely lunatic.\n",
      "<br>There's the Countess of Rothes.\n",
      "<br>That's John Jacob Astor...\n",
      "<br>...the richest man on board.\n",
      "<br>His little wifey, Madeleine,\n",
      "is my age and in a delicate condition.\n",
      "<br>See how she tries to hide it.\n",
      "<br>Quite the scandal.\n",
      "<br>Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,\n",
      "Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...\n",
      "<br>...is at home with the children, of course.\n",
      "And over here...\n",
      "<br>...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.\n",
      "<br>She designs naughty lingerie,\n",
      "among her many talents.\n",
      "<br>Very popular with the royals.\n",
      "<br>Congratulations. She's splendid.\n",
      "<br>Why, thank you.\n",
      "<br>Escort a lady to dinner?\n",
      "<br>Certainly.\n",
      "<br>Sweet pea, sweet pea.\n",
      "<br>Ain't nothing to it.\n",
      "<br>They love money. Pretend like you own\n",
      "a gold mine and you're in the club.\n",
      "<br>Hey, Astor.\n",
      "<br>Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.\n",
      "<br>J.J., Madeleine,\n",
      "I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.\n",
      "<br>Well, Jack...\n",
      "<br>...are you of the Boston Dawsons?\n",
      "<br>No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.\n",
      "<br>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br>He must have been nervous,\n",
      "but he never faltered.\n",
      "<br>They assumed he was one of them.\n",
      "<br>Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.\n",
      "<br>New money, obviously,\n",
      "but still a member of the club.\n",
      "<br>Mother, of course,\n",
      "could always be counted upon.\n",
      "<br>Tell us of the accommodations in steerage\n",
      "Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good-\n",
      "<br>The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.\n",
      "<br>Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.\n",
      "<br>He was of help to my fiancée last night.\n",
      "<br>It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.\n",
      "<br>He showed me some of his work today.\n",
      "<br>Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.\n",
      "Not to impugn your work, sir.\n",
      "<br>Are all these mine?\n",
      "<br>Start from the outside and work in.\n",
      "<br>He knows every rivet in her.\n",
      "<br>Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br>Thank you, Rose.\n",
      "<br>How do you take your caviar, sir?\n",
      "<br>No caviar for me, thanks.\n",
      "Never did like it much.\n",
      "<br>Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?\n",
      "<br>Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.\n",
      "<br>After that, I'm on God's good humor.\n",
      "<br>How do you have means to travel?\n",
      "<br>I work my way from place to place.\n",
      "Tramp steamers and such.\n",
      "<br>I won my ticket on Titanic\n",
      "at a lucky hand at poker.\n",
      "<br>A very lucky hand.\n",
      "<br>All life is a game of luck.\n",
      "<br>A real man makes his own luck.\n",
      "Right, Dawson?\n",
      "<br>And you find\n",
      "that sort of rootless existence appealing?\n",
      "<br>Yes, ma'am, I do.\n",
      "<br>I've got everything I need\n",
      "right here with me.\n",
      "<br>I have air in my lungs\n",
      "and blank sheets of paper.\n",
      "<br>I love waking up, not knowing\n",
      "what will happen or who I'll meet.\n",
      "<br>Where I'll wind up.\n",
      "<br>One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...\n",
      "<br>...now I'm on the grandest ship\n",
      "in the world, with you fine people.\n",
      "<br>I'll take more of that.\n",
      "<br>Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.\n",
      "<br>You never know what hand you'll get dealt.\n",
      "<br>You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.\n",
      "<br>Make each day count.\n",
      "<br>Well said, Jack.\n",
      "<br>Hear, hear.\n",
      "<br>To making it count.\n",
      "<br>To making it count.\n",
      "<br>Bravo.\n",
      "<br>But Mr. Brown didn't know\n",
      "I'd hidden the money in the stove.\n",
      "<br>He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating\n",
      "and lights a fire.\n",
      "<br>Next is brandy in the smoking room.\n",
      "<br>Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?\n",
      "<br>Now they retreat to congratulate each\n",
      "other on being masters of the universe.\n",
      "<br>Ladies, thank you for your company.\n",
      "<br>May I escort you to the cabin?\n",
      "<br>No, I'll stay here.\n",
      "<br>Here, Molly.\n",
      "<br>Joining us, Dawson?\n",
      "<br>You don't want to stay with the women.\n",
      "<br>No, thanks. I have to head back.\n",
      "<br>That's best. It'll be all business and politics.\n",
      "Wouldn't interest you.\n",
      "<br>But Dawson, good of you to come.\n",
      "<br>Must you go?\n",
      "<br>Time for me to row with the other slaves.\n",
      "<br>Good night, Rose.\n",
      "<br>Want to go to a real party?\n",
      "<br>Is okay I put my hand here?\n",
      "<br>I can't understand you.\n",
      "<br>I'm going to dance with her now.\n",
      "<br>Come on.\n",
      "<br>Come on. Come with me.\n",
      "<br>Jack. Jack, wait.\n",
      "<br>I can't do this.\n",
      "<br>We'll have to get a bit closer.\n",
      "<br>Like this.\n",
      "<br>You're still my best girl, Cora.\n",
      "<br>- I don't know the steps.\n",
      "- Me, either. Just go with it.\n",
      "<br>Don't think.\n",
      "<br>Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!\n",
      "<br>Wh at? Wait!\n",
      "<br>Jack, no.\n",
      "<br>--Beyond the jurisdiction\n",
      "of the Sherman Act.\n",
      "<br>That's what Rockefeller said--\n",
      "Supreme Court didn't swallow it.\n",
      "<br>What? You think\n",
      "a first-class girl can't drink?\n",
      "<br>Get out of here.\n",
      "<br>Are you all right?\n",
      "<br>I'm fine.\n",
      "<br>Two out of three.\n",
      "<br>So...\n",
      "<br>...you think you're tough?\n",
      "<br>Let's see you do this.\n",
      "<br>Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.\n",
      "<br>Jesus!\n",
      "<br>You okay?\n",
      "<br>I haven't done that in years.\n",
      "<br>Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go.\n",
      "<br>Coffee, sir?\n",
      "<br>You didn't come to me last night.\n",
      "<br>I was tired.\n",
      "<br>Your exertions below deck\n",
      "were no doubt exhausting.\n",
      "<br>I see you had\n",
      "that undertaker of a manservant follow me.\n",
      "<br>You will never behave like that again.\n",
      "<br>I'm not one of your mill foremen\n",
      "who you can command.\n",
      "<br>I'm your fiancée.\n",
      "<br>My fiancée. My fiancée!\n",
      "<br>Yes, you are! And my wife!\n",
      "<br>My wife in practice,\n",
      "if not yet by law, so you will honor me!\n",
      "<br>You will honor me the way\n",
      "a wife honors her husband.\n",
      "<br>Because I will not be made a fool of.\n",
      "<br>Is this in any way unclear?\n",
      "<br>No.\n",
      "<br>Good. Excuse me.\n",
      "<br>Oh, Miss Rose.\n",
      "<br>We had a little accident.\n",
      "<br>- That's all right.\n",
      "- I'm sorry.\n",
      "<br>Let me help you.\n",
      "<br>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br>Tea, Trudy.\n",
      "<br>You're not to see that boy again.\n",
      "You understand?\n",
      "<br>Rose, I forbid it.\n",
      "<br>Stop it, Mother.\n",
      "You'll give yourself a nosebleed.\n",
      "<br>This is not a game.\n",
      "<br>Our situation is precarious.\n",
      "You know the money's gone.\n",
      "<br>Of course I know.\n",
      "You remind me every day.\n",
      "<br>Your father left us nothing but a legacy\n",
      "of bad debts hidden by a good name.\n",
      "<br>That name is the only card we have to play.\n",
      "<br>I don't understand you.\n",
      "<br>It is a fine match with Hockley.\n",
      "It will ensure our survival.\n",
      "<br>How can you put this on me?\n",
      "<br>Why are you being so selfish?\n",
      "<br>I'm being selfish?\n",
      "<br>Do you want to see me\n",
      "working as a seamstress?\n",
      "<br>Is that what you want?\n",
      "<br>To see our fine things sold at auction?\n",
      "<br>Our memories scattered?\n",
      "<br>It's so unfair.\n",
      "<br>Of course it's unfair.\n",
      "<br>We're women.\n",
      "<br>Our choices are never easy.\n",
      "<br>Protect them by Thy guiding hand\n",
      "<br>From every peril on the land\n",
      "<br>O, spirit whom the Father sent\n",
      "<br>To spread abroad the firmament\n",
      "<br>O, wind of heaven, by Thy might\n",
      "<br>Save all who dare the eagle 's ﬂight\n",
      "<br>And keep them by Thy watchful care...\n",
      "<br>Hello, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br>I need to talk to someone.\n",
      "<br>You're not supposed to be in here.\n",
      "<br>I was here last night, remember?\n",
      "<br>No. Now please turn around.\n",
      "<br>He'll tell you. I just need to talk--\n",
      "<br>Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...\n",
      "<br>...are still appreciative of your assistance.\n",
      "<br>They asked me\n",
      "to give you this in gratitude--\n",
      "<br>I don't want your money.\n",
      "<br>--And remind you you are\n",
      "in third class and your presence here...\n",
      "<br>...is no longer appropriate.\n",
      "<br>Let me speak to Rose.\n",
      "<br>Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson\n",
      "returns to where he belongs...\n",
      "<br>...and that he stays there?\n",
      "<br>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br>Come along, you.\n",
      "<br>Hear us when we cry to Thee\n",
      "<br>For those in peril on the sea\n",
      "<br>Why are there two steering wheels?\n",
      "<br>We use this one near shore.\n",
      "<br>Excuse me, sir.\n",
      "Another ice warning, from the Noordam.\n",
      "<br>Thank you, Sparks.\n",
      "<br>Not to worry.\n",
      "Quite normal for this time of year.\n",
      "<br>In fact, we're speeding up.\n",
      "I've ordered the last boilers lit.\n",
      "<br>Okay, son, wind it up tight\n",
      "like I showed you. That's right.\n",
      "<br>Okay, now let it go.\n",
      "<br>- It was good, wasn't it?\n",
      "- Quite nice. That's excellent.\n",
      "<br>Mr. Andrews...Forgive me.\n",
      "<br>I did the sum\n",
      "in my head...\n",
      "<br>...and with the number of lifeboats\n",
      "times the capacity you mentioned...\n",
      "<br>Forgive me, but it seems that there are\n",
      "not enough for everyone aboard.\n",
      "<br>About half, actually.\n",
      "<br>Rose, you miss nothing,\n",
      "do you?\n",
      "<br>In fact, I put in these new\n",
      "type davits...\n",
      "<br>...which can take an extra row\n",
      "of boats inside this one.\n",
      "<br>But it was thought,\n",
      "by some...\n",
      "<br>...the deck would look\n",
      "too cluttered.\n",
      "<br>So, I was overruled.\n",
      "<br>It's a waste of deck space\n",
      "as it is on an unsinkable ship.\n",
      "<br>Sleep soundly, young Rose.\n",
      "<br>I have built you a good ship,\n",
      "strong and true.\n",
      "<br>She's all the lifeboat\n",
      "you need.\n",
      "<br>Just keep heading aft. The next\n",
      "stop will be the engine room.\n",
      "<br>Jack, this is impossible.\n",
      "I can't see you.\n",
      "<br>- I need to talk to you.\n",
      "- No, Jack. No.\n",
      "<br>Jack.\n",
      "I'm engaged.\n",
      "<br>I'm marrying Cal.\n",
      "<br>I love Cal.\n",
      "<br>Rose...\n",
      "<br>...you're no picnic. All right?\n",
      "You're a spoiled little brat even.\n",
      "<br>But under that, you're the\n",
      "most amazingly, astounding\n",
      "<br>...wonderful girl...\n",
      "<br>...woman, that I've ever known.\n",
      "<br>Jack, I--\n",
      "<br>No, let me try and get\n",
      "this out. You're ama--\n",
      "<br>I'm not an idiot.\n",
      "I know how the world works.\n",
      "<br>I've got ten bucks\n",
      "in my pocket.\n",
      "<br>I have nothing to offer\n",
      "you and I know that.\n",
      "<br>I understand.\n",
      "<br>But I'm too involved now.\n",
      "<br>You jump, I jump\n",
      "Remember?\n",
      "<br>I can't turn away without\n",
      "knowing you'll be all right.\n",
      "<br>That's all that I want.\n",
      "<br>Well, I'm fine.\n",
      "<br>I'll be fine. Really.\n",
      "<br>Really?\n",
      "<br>I don't think so.\n",
      "<br>They've got you trapped, Rose.\n",
      "<br>And you're gonna die if you\n",
      "don't break free.\n",
      "<br>Maybe not right away...\n",
      "<br>...because you're strong...\n",
      "<br>...but sooner or later that\n",
      "fire that I love about you, Rose...\n",
      "<br>...that fire is gonna\n",
      "burn out.\n",
      "<br>It's not up to you\n",
      "to save me, Jack.\n",
      "<br>You're right.\n",
      "<br>Only you can do that.\n",
      "<br>I'm going back.\n",
      "<br>Leave me alone.\n",
      "<br>Tell Lucile about the disaster\n",
      "you had with the stationers.\n",
      "<br>Well, of course the invitations\n",
      "had to be sent back, twice.\n",
      "<br>Oh, my dear.\n",
      "<br>And the dreadful\n",
      "bridesmaids' gowns.\n",
      "<br>Let me tell you what an\n",
      "odyssey that has been.\n",
      "<br>Rose decided she\n",
      "wanted lavender.\n",
      "<br>She knows I detest the color.\n",
      "<br>So, she did it only to spite me.\n",
      "<br>If only you'd come to\n",
      "me sooner.\n",
      "<br>Ruth saw some of my designs in\n",
      "La Mode Illustrée.\n",
      "<br>They were for the trousseau of the Duchess\n",
      "of Marlborough's youngest daughter.\n",
      "<br>They were quite charming.\n",
      "<br>But, I think you'll agree,\n",
      "my dear, that together...\n",
      "<br>...we've created something\n",
      "of a phoenix from the ashes.\n",
      "<br>Hello, Jack.\n",
      "<br>I changed my mind.\n",
      "<br>They said you might be up here.\n",
      "<br>Give me your hand.\n",
      "<br>Now close your eyes.\n",
      "<br>Go on.\n",
      "<br>Now, step up.\n",
      "<br>Now, hold onto the railing.\n",
      "<br>Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "Don't peek.\n",
      "<br>I'm not.\n",
      "<br>Now, step up onto the rail.\n",
      "<br>Hold on. Hold on.\n",
      "<br>Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "<br>Do you trust me?\n",
      "<br>I trust you.\n",
      "<br>All right...\n",
      "<br>---Open your eyes.\n",
      "<br>I'm flying.\n",
      "<br>Jack.\n",
      "<br>Come, Josephine, in my\n",
      "ﬂying machine. Going up...\n",
      "<br>...she goes. Up she goes.\n",
      "<br>That was the last time\n",
      "Titanic ever saw daylight.\n",
      "<br>We're up to dusk the\n",
      "night of the sinking.\n",
      "<br>6 hours to go.\n",
      "<br>Incredible. There's Smith and\n",
      "he's standing there and...\n",
      "<br>...he's got the iceberg warning\n",
      "in his fucking hand...\n",
      "<br>...excuse me--his hand,\n",
      "and he's ordering more speed.\n",
      "<br>26 years of experience\n",
      "working against him.\n",
      "<br>He figures anything big\n",
      "enough to sink, the ship...\n",
      "<br>...they're gonna see in time to turn.\n",
      "<br>But the ship's too big\n",
      "with too small a rudder.\n",
      "<br>Doesn't corner worth a damn.\n",
      "<br>Everything he knows\n",
      "is wrong.\n",
      "<br>It's quite proper, I assure you.\n",
      "This is the sitting room.\n",
      "<br>- Will this light do?\n",
      "- What?\n",
      "<br>Don't artists need good light?\n",
      "<br>That is true, but I'm not\n",
      "used to working in...\n",
      "<br>...such horrible conditions.\n",
      "<br>Monet!\n",
      "<br>- Do you know his work?\n",
      "- Of course.\n",
      "<br>Look at his use of color here.\n",
      "Isn't he great?\n",
      "<br>I know. It's extraordinary.\n",
      "<br>Cal insists on carting\n",
      "this hideous thing everywhere.\n",
      "<br>Should we be expecting him\n",
      "any time soon?\n",
      "<br>Not as long as the cigars\n",
      "and brandy hold out.\n",
      "<br>That's nice.\n",
      "<br>What is it,\n",
      "a sapphire?\n",
      "<br>A diamond.\n",
      "<br>A very rare diamond.\n",
      "<br>Jack, I want you to draw me\n",
      "like one of your French girls.\n",
      "<br>Wearing this.\n",
      "<br>All right.\n",
      "<br>Wearing only this.\n",
      "<br>The last thing I need is another picture of me\n",
      "looking like a porcelain doll.\n",
      "<br>As a paying customer...\n",
      "<br>...I expect to get\n",
      "what I want.\n",
      "<br>Over on the bed\n",
      "...uh, the couch.\n",
      "<br>Come. Lie down.\n",
      "<br>- Tell me when it looks right.\n",
      "- Keep that.\n",
      "<br>Put your arm back\n",
      "the way it was.\n",
      "<br>Put that other arm up,\n",
      "that hand right by your face there.\n",
      "<br>Right.\n",
      "<br>Now, head down.\n",
      "<br>Eyes to me.\n",
      "Keep them on me.\n",
      "<br>And try to stay still.\n",
      "<br>So serious.\n",
      "<br>I believe you are blushing,\n",
      "Mr. Big Artiste.\n",
      "<br>I can't imagine\n",
      "Monsieur Monet blushing.\n",
      "<br>He does landscapes.\n",
      "<br>- Just relax your face.\n",
      "- Sorry.\n",
      "<br>No laughing.\n",
      "<br>My heart was pounding\n",
      "the whole time.\n",
      "<br>It was the most erotic\n",
      "moment of my life...\n",
      "<br>...up until then, at least.\n",
      "<br>So what happened next?\n",
      "<br>You mean,\n",
      "did we do it?\n",
      "<br>Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.\n",
      "<br>Jack was very professional.\n",
      "<br>Thank you.\n",
      "<br>What are you doing?\n",
      "<br>Will you put this\n",
      "back in the safe for me?\n",
      "<br>Gentlemen, would you excuse me.\n",
      "<br>None of the stewards\n",
      "have seen her.\n",
      "<br>This is absurd.\n",
      "It's a ship.\n",
      "<br>There's only so many\n",
      "places she could be.\n",
      "<br>Lovejoy, find her.\n",
      "<br>- Clear.\n",
      "- Yes.\n",
      "<br>I don't think I've ever\n",
      "seen such a flat calm.\n",
      "<br>Like a mill pond.\n",
      "<br>Not a breath of wind.\n",
      "<br>It will make the bergs\n",
      "harder to see---\n",
      "<br>...with no breaking\n",
      "water at the base.\n",
      "<br>Well, I'm off.\n",
      "<br>Maintain speed and\n",
      "heading, Mr. Lightoller.\n",
      "<br>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br>It's getting cold.\n",
      "You look nice.\n",
      "<br>Miss Rose?\n",
      "<br>My drawings!\n",
      "<br>Come on!\n",
      "<br>Wait, wait, wait!\n",
      "<br>Wait, wait, wait!\n",
      "<br>- Go. Go. Down, down.\n",
      "- Take us down, quickly. Quickly!\n",
      "<br>Bye.\n",
      "<br>Sorry.\n",
      "<br>- Keep going.\n",
      "- Thank you, I've got it.\n",
      "<br>Pretty tough for\n",
      "a valet, this fella.\n",
      "<br>Seems more like a cop.\n",
      "<br>I think he was.\n",
      "<br>- Oh, shit.\n",
      "- Go!\n",
      "<br>No, over here!\n",
      "<br>Quick!\n",
      "<br>Now what?\n",
      "<br>Wh at?\n",
      "<br>More coal for number\n",
      "one, mate.\n",
      "<br>Hold up? What are you two\n",
      "doing down here?\n",
      "<br>You shouldn't be down here.\n",
      "<br>It could be dangerous!\n",
      "<br>Carry on!\n",
      "<br>Don't mind us. You're\n",
      "doing a great job!\n",
      "<br>Keep up the good work!\n",
      "<br>Look at what we have here, huh?\n",
      "<br>Thank you.\n",
      "<br>Where to, miss?\n",
      "<br>To the stars.\n",
      "<br>You nervous?\n",
      "<br>No.\n",
      "<br>Put your hands on me, Jack.\n",
      "<br>It's bloody cold.\n",
      "<br>You know, I can smell ice, you know.\n",
      "When it's near.\n",
      "<br>Bollocks!\n",
      "<br>Well, I can, all right?\n",
      "<br>Did you ever find those\n",
      "binoculars for the lookouts?\n",
      "<br>Haven't seen them\n",
      "since Southampton.\n",
      "<br>Well, I'll be on\n",
      "my rounds.\n",
      "<br>Cheerio.\n",
      "<br>You're trembling.\n",
      "<br>Don't worry.\n",
      "<br>I'll be all right.\n",
      "<br>- They ran down there.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "<br>Anything missing?\n",
      "<br>I have a better idea.\n",
      "<br>GOI you!\n",
      "<br>Did you see those guys' faces?\n",
      "<br>Did you see them?\n",
      "<br>When the ship docks...\n",
      "<br>...I'm getting off with you.\n",
      "<br>This is crazy.\n",
      "<br>I know. It doesn't make any sense.\n",
      "<br>That's why I trust it.\n",
      "<br>Here, look at this.\n",
      "<br>Look at that, would you?\n",

      "<br>Is anyone there?!\n",
      "<br>What do you see?\n",
      "<br>Iceberg, right ahead!\n",
      "<br>Thank you.\n",
      "<br>Iceberg ahead!\n",
      "<br>Hard a' starboard!\n",
      "<br>Turn! Turn! Srnartly!\n",
      "<br>Full astern!\n",
      "<br>Hard over.\n",
      "<br>Helm's hard over, sir.\n",
      "<br>Go, lads, go!\n",
      "<br>Bring that steam down! Bring it down!\n",
      "<br>Shut all the dampers! Shut them!\n",
      "<br>Hold it.\n",
      "<br>Hold it!\n",
      "<br>Now! Engage reversing engine!\n",
      "<br>Why ain't they turning?\n",
      "<br>Is it hard over?!\n",
      "<br>It is, sir. Hard over.\n",
      "<br>Come on, come on, come on. Turn.\n",
      "<br>Yes.\n",
      "<br>It's going to hit!\n",
      "<br>Jesus Christ!\n",
      "<br>Jesus!\n",
      "<br>Hard to port!\n",
      "<br>Hard to port!\n",
      "<br>Get back!\n",
      "<br>Let's go!\n",
      "<br>They're closing the doors! Get out!\n",
      "<br>Get out the door! Go!\n",
      "<br>Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!\n",
      "<br>Go! Go!\n",
      "<br>Out! Out!\n",
      "<br>Oh, my God.\n",
      "<br>That was a close shave.\n",
      "<br>Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!\n",
      "<br>Note the time. Enter it in the log.\n",
      "<br>What was that, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br>An iceberg, sir.\n",
      "<br>I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close.\n",
      "<br>I tried to port round it, but--\n",
      "<br>- Close the watertight doors.\n",
      "- They're closed, sir.\n",
      "<br>All stop.\n",
      "<br>Have the carpenter sound the ship.\n",
      "<br>Come on, let's get the hell out of here!\n",
      "<br>Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder.\n",
      "<br>Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.\n",
      "<br>That's the shudder you felt.\n",
      "Do you need anything?\n",
      "<br>No, thank you.\n",
      "<br>There's talk of an iceberg.\n",
      "<br>I don't see anything. Do you?\n",
      "<br>If this is where the rats are going, I am, too.\n",
      "<br>- You.\n",
      "- There is no emergency.\n",
      "<br>- There is. I've been robbed.\n",
      "- Get the Master at Arms.\n",
      "<br>Now, you moron!\n",
      "<br>Did I miss the fun?\n",
      "<br>- Did you see what happened?\n",
      "- No- I guess it hit over there-\n",
      "<br>Boiler room six is flooded eight feet\n",
      "and the mail hold is worse.\n",
      "<br>- Can you shore up?\n",
      "- Not unless the pumps get ahead.\n",
      "<br>- Have you seen the mail hold?\n",
      "- It's already underwater.\n",
      "<br>This is bad.\n",
      "<br>We should tell Mother and Cal.\n",
      "<br>I think they're very good, sir.\n",
      "<br>Don't touch anything.\n",
      "I want the room photographed.\n",
      "<br>We've been looking for you, miss.\n",
      "<br>Here we go.\n",
      "<br>Something serious has happened.\n",
      "<br>Yes, it has.\n",
      "<br>Indeed.\n",
      "Two things dear to me have disappeared.\n",
      "<br>Now that one is back,\n",
      "I know where to find the other. Search him.\n",
      "<br>- Take your coat off.\n",
      "- Now what?\n",
      "<br>What are you doing?\n",
      "We're in the middle of an emergency.\n",
      "<br>- Is this it?\n",
      "- That's it.\n",
      "<br>This is horseshit!\n",
      "<br>Don't you believe it.\n",
      "<br>- He couldn't have.\n",
      "- Easy enough for a professional.\n",
      "<br>I was with him the entire time.\n",
      "<br>Perhaps he did it while you were putting\n",
      "your clothes back on, dear.\n",
      "<br>Real slick. They put it in my pocket.\n",
      "<br>- Shut up.\n",
      "- It isn't even your pocket.\n",
      "<br>\"Property of A.L. Ryerson.\"\n",
      "<br>That was reported stolen.\n",
      "<br>I just borrowed it.\n",
      "<br>Oh, we have an honest thief.\n",
      "<br>You know I didn't do this, Rose.\n",
      "<br>Don't believe them. You know it.\n",
      "<br>Let's go, son.\n",
      "<br>You know I didn't do it!\n",
      "<br>There's a good lad. Come on.\n",
      "<br>You know I didn't do it! You know me!\n",
      "<br>This is most unfortunate, Captain.\n",
      "<br>Water fourteen feet above the keel\n",
      "in ten minutes...\n",
      "<br>...in the forepeak,\n",
      "all three holds and boiler room six.\n",
      "<br>That's right.\n",
      "<br>When can we get underway?\n",
      "<br>That's five compartments.\n",
      "<br>She can float with four compartments breached,\n",
      "but not five.\n",
      "<br>Not five. As she goes down,\n",
      "the water will spill...\n",
      "<br>...over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,\n",
      "one to the next...\n",
      "<br>...back and back. There's no stopping it.\n",
      "<br>The pumps.\n",
      "<br>The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.\n",
      "<br>As of now, no matter what we do...\n",
      "<br>...Titanic will founder.\n",
      "<br>But this ship can't sink.\n",
      "<br>She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.\n",
      "<br>And she will.\n",
      "<br>It's a mathematical certainty.\n",
      "<br>How much time?\n",
      "<br>An hour. Two, at most.\n",
      "<br>How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br>Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.\n",
      "<br>Well, I believe you may get your headlines,\n",
      "Mr. lsmay.\n",
      "<br>Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?\n",
      "<br>Look at me when I'm talking to you!\n",
      "<br>- Mr. Hockley?\n",
      "- Not now. We're busy.\n",
      "<br>You've been asked to put on lifebelts\n",
      "and go to the boat deck.\n",
      "<br>I said, not now.\n",
      "<br>I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.\n",
      "Dress warmly.\n",
      "<br>It's quite cold out.\n",
      "<br>May I suggest topcoats and hats?\n",
      "<br>This is ridiculous.\n",
      "<br>Not to worry, miss.\n",
      "I'm sure it's just a precaution.\n",
      "<br>Everybody up! Lifebelts on!\n",
      "<br>What's he on about?\n",
      "<br>- Put your lifebelts on!\n",
      "- What is it?\n",
      "<br>Just put them on.\n",
      "<br>C.O.D.?\n",
      "<br>Sir?\n",
      "<br>That's right, C.O.D. The distress call.\n",
      "That's our position.\n",
      "<br>Tell whoever responds we're going down\n",
      "and need immediate assistance.\n",
      "<br>Blimey.\n",
      "<br>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br>Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!\n",
      "<br>Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft!\n",
      "<br>Release those ties!\n",
      "<br>Roll back that cover! Smartly now!\n",
      "<br>Where are the passengers?\n",
      "<br>They went inside- Too cold and noisy for them\n",
      "<br>You there! Get down here\n",
      "and help with these lines!\n",
      "<br>Care for a drink, sir?\n",
      "<br>Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed up\n",
      "and now we're cooling our heels.\n",
      "<br>Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.\n",
      "<br>Nobody knows what's going on.\n",
      "<br>Just like the damn English--everything by the book.\n",
      "<br>No need for language, Mr. Hockley.\n",
      "<br>Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.\n",
      "I want a cup of tea when I return.\n",
      "<br>Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br>I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.\n",
      "<br>Please tell me the truth.\n",
      "<br>The ship will sink.\n",
      "<br>You're certain?\n",
      "<br>In an hour or so, all this\n",
      "will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.\n",
      "<br>Please, tell only who you must.\n",
      "I don't want to cause a panic.\n",
      "<br>And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.\n",
      "<br>You remember what I told you about the boats?\n",
      "<br>Yes.\n",
      "<br>I understand.\n",
      "<br>Over here, son.\n",
      "<br>Sir, there's a big mob\n",
      "at the Second Class Purser's office.\n",
      "<br>Go on. I'll watch him.\n",
      "<br>Aye. Right.\n",
      "<br>Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.\n",
      "Full steam for them, sir.\n",
      "<br>She's the only one responding?\n",
      "<br>The only one close. They'll be here in four hours.\n",
      "<br>Four hours?!\n",
      "<br>Thank you, Bride.\n",
      "<br>My God.\n",
      "<br>We are swung out and ready, sir.\n",
      "<br>Hadn't we better get the women and children\n",
      "into the boats?\n",
      "<br>Yes.\n",
      "<br>Women and children first, yes.\n",
      "<br>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br>Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!\n",
      "<br>Step this way, please. That's right.\n",
      "<br>Come towards me. Thank you.\n",
      "<br>Good.\n",
      "<br>For the time being,\n",
      "I require only women and children\n",
      "<br>Right here.\n",
      "<br>Like the Captain said,\n",
      "nice and cheery, so there's no panic.\n",
      "<br>\"Wedding Dance.\"\n",
      "<br>Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.\n",
      "<br>Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.\n",
      "<br>Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around.\n",
      "<br>It isn't time to go to the boats yet!\n",
      "<br>Please, stay calm.\n",
      "<br>Make sure you have your lifebelts on.\n",
      "<br>Let women and children through to the front.\n",
      "<br>What are we doing?\n",
      "<br>Waiting. Once first-class people\n",
      "are in the boats...\n",
      "<br>...they'll start with us and we want to be ready.\n",
      "<br>Pushing won't get you out any faster.\n",
      "<br>Go get help.\n",
      "<br>Lower it away, left and right together! Steady.\n",
      "<br>Both sides together! Steady!\n",
      "<br>Steady!\n",
      "<br>Steady!\n",

      "<br>Come on, sister, you heard\n",
      "the man. Into the boat.\n",
      "<br>Any room for a gentleman,\n",
      "gentlemen?\n",
      "<br>Only women at this time, sir.\n",
      "<br>Will the lifeboats be\n",
      "seated according to class?\n",
      "<br>I hope they're not too crowded.\n",
      "<br>Oh, Mother, shut up!\n",
      "<br>Don't you understand?\n",
      "<br>The water is freezing and\n",

      "<br>Not enough by half.\n",
      "<br>Half the people on this\n",

      "<br>Not the better half.\n",
      "<br>Come on, Ruth,\n",
      "get in the boat.\n",
      "<br>First class seats\n",
      "are right up here.\n",

      "<br/>You are so full of shit, boss.\n",
      "<br/>Dive 6. Here we are again\n",

      "<br/>2% miles down\n",

      "9 inches thick.\n",
      "<br/>If they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds.\n",
      "<br/>All right, enough of that bullshit.\n",
      "<br/>Just put her down on the roof of\n",
      "the officers' quarters like yesterday.\n",
      "<br/>Mir 2, we're landing right over the\n",
      "Grand Staircase. You guys set to launch?\n",

      "<br/>- Okay, A deck.\n",
      "- Give me some rope, Captain.\n",
      "<br/>B deck. Get in there. Get in there.\n",
      "<br/>Watch the door frame.\n",

      "<br/>We're in!\n",
      "<br/>We're in, baby. We're there.\n",
      "<br/>That's Hockley's bed.\n",
      "<br/>That's where the\n",

      "<br/>Hold it. Hold it just a second.\n",
      "Go back to the right.\n",
      "<br/>That wardrobe door.\n",

      "<br/>You smelling something, boss?\n",
      "<br/>- I want to see what's under it.\n",
      "- Give me my hands, man.\n",
      "<br/>All right.\n",
      "<br/>- Take it easy. It might come apart.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "<br/>Go, go, go. Flip it over.\n",
      "Flip it over. Go.\n",
      "<br/>Turn her over. Keep going.\n",
      "<br/>Go, Q0, 9°-\n",
      "<br/>Okay, drop it.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, baby, baby.\n",
      "Are you seeing this, boss?\n",
      "<br/>It's payday, boys.\n",
      "<br/>Cha-ching!\n",
      "<br/>- We did it, Bobby.\n",
      "- We brought it back, Baby.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yeah! Who's the best?\n",
      "Who's the best, baby?\n",
      "<br/>Say it. Say it. Say it.\n",
      "<br/>You are, Lewis.\n",
      "<br/>- Bobby, my cigar.\n",
      "- Right here.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, crack her open.\n",
      "<br/>Shit.\n",
      "<br/>No diamond.\n",
      "<br/>You know boss, this same thing happened\n",
      "to Geraldo and his career never recovered.\n",
      "<br/>Turn the camera off.\n",
      "<br/>Brock, the partners would like\n",
      "to know how it's going.\n",
      "<br/>Hey, Dave, Barry, hi. Look, I it wasn't\n",
      "in the safe. But hey, hey...\n",
      "<br/>...Don't worry about it. There's still\n",
      "plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes.\n",
      "<br/>The floor debris in the suite,\n",
      "the mother's room...\n",
      "<br/>the purser's safe on C deck.\n",
      "<br/>Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.\n",
      "<br/>A dozen other places. Guys, look, you're just\n",
      "going to have to trust my instincts. I know we're close.\n",
      "<br/>We've just got to go through a little\n",
      "process of elimination.\n",
      "<br/>Hang on a second.\n",
      "<br/>- Let me see that.\n",
      "- Ah, we may have something here, guys.\n",
      "<br/>Where's the photograph\n",
      "of the necklace?\n",
      "<br/>We'll call you right back.\n",
      "<br/>I'll be goddamned.\n",
      "<br/>Treasure hunter Brock Lovett\n",
      "is best known for finding Spanish gold...\n",
      "<br/>It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute.\n",
      "<br/>Now he has chartered Russian subs to reach\n",
      "the most famous shipwreck of all, the Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>He is with us live via satellite\n",
      "from the research ship Keldysh...\n",
      "<br/>...in the North Atlantic. Hello, Brock.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows\n",
      "the familiar stories of Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>You know, the nobility of the\n",
      "band playing to the very end and all that.\n",
      "<br/>But what I'm interested in are the untold stories.\n",
      "The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>And we're out here using robot\n",
      "technology to go further into the wreck...\n",
      "<br/>...than anybody has ever done before.\n",
      "<br/>Your expedition is at the center\n",
      "of a storm of controversy...\n",
      "<br/>...over salvage rights and even ethics.\n",
      "Many are calling you a graverobber.\n",
      "<br/>Well, nobody ever called the\n",
      "recovery of the artifacts...\n",
      "<br/>What is it?\n",
      "<br/>Turn that up, dear.\n",
      "<br/>I have museum-trained experts\n",
      "sent out here making sure...\n",
      "<br/>---that these relics are preserved\n",
      "and catalogued properly.\n",
      "<br/>Take a look at this drawing\n",
      "that we found just today.\n",
      "<br/>A piece of paper that's been underwater\n",
      "for 84 years.\n",
      "<br/>And my team are able to\n",
      "preserve it intact.\n",
      "<br/>Should this have remained unseen\n",
      "at the bottom of the ocean for eternity...\n",
      "<br/>...when we can see and enjoy it now?\n",
      "<br/>I'll be goddamned.\n",
      "<br/>Brock!\n",
      "<br/>There's a satellite call for you.\n",
      "<br/>Bobby, we're launching. You see\n",
      "these submersibles going in the water?\n",
      "<br/>Trust me, buddy.\n",
      "You want to take this call.\n",
      "<br/>This better be good.\n",
      "<br/>Now, you gotta speak up.\n",
      "She's kind of old.\n",
      "<br/>Great.\n",
      "<br/>This is Brock Lovett.\n",
      "How can I help you, Mrs...?\n",
      "<br/>Calvert. Rose Calvert.\n",
      "<br/>Mrs. Calvert.\n",
      "<br/>I was just wondering if you had found...\n",
      "<br/>...the \"Heart of the Ocean\" yet, Mr. Lovett.\n",
      "<br/>Told you you wanted to take the call.\n",
      "<br/>All right, you have my\n",
      "attention, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Can you tell us who the woman\n",
      "in the picture is?\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.\n",
      "<br/>She's a goddamn liar!\n",
      "Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.\n",
      "<br/>God only knows why.\n",
      "Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.\n",
      "<br/>They're inbound!\n",
      "<br/>Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the\n",
      "Titanic when she was 17, right?\n",
      "<br/>- That's right.\n",
      "- If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.\n",
      "<br/>101 next month.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.\n",
      "<br/>Look, I've already done the\n",
      "background on this woman...\n",
      "<br/>...all the way back to the 20s,\n",
      "when she was working as an actress.\n",
      "<br/>An actress.\n",
      "There's your first clue, Sherlock.\n",
      "<br/>Her name was Rose Dawson back then.\n",
      "Then she marries this guy named Calvert.\n",
      "<br/>They move to Cedar Rapids\n",
      "and she punches out a couple of kids.\n",
      "<br/>Now Calvert's dead\n",
      "and, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.\n",
      "<br/>And everybody who knows about the\n",
      "diamond is supposed to be dead...\n",
      "<br/>...or on this boat,\n",
      "but she knows.\n",
      "<br/>Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?\n",
      "<br/>Hurry up, give him a hand.\n",
      "<br/>Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.\n",
      "Welcome to the Keldysh.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, let's get her inside there.\n",
      "<br/>Hi, Miss Calvert.\n",
      "<br/>- Hi.\n",
      "- Welcome to the Keldysh.\n",
      "<br/>Thanks.\n",
      "<br/>Hey!\n",
      "<br/>Are your staterooms\n",
      "all right?\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br/>Very nice.\n",
      "<br/>Have you met my\n",
      "granddaughter, Lizzy?\n",
      "<br/>She takes care of me.\n",
      "<br/>We met just a few\n",
      "minutes ago.\n",
      "<br/>Remember, Nana?\n",
      "Up on deck?\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br/>There. That's nice.\n",
      "<br/>Have to have my\n",
      "pictures when I travel.\n",
      "<br/>Can I get you anything?\n",
      "<br/>Is there anything you'd like?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I would like to\n",
      "see my drawing.\n",
      "<br/>Louis XVI wore a fabulous\n",
      "stone that was...\n",
      "<br/>...called the Blue Diamond\n",
      "of the Crown...\n",
      "<br/>...which disappeared\n",
      "in 1792...\n",
      "<br/>...about the same time old Louis lost\n",
      "everything from the neck up.\n",
      "<br/>The theory goes that the\n",
      "crown diamond was chopped, too.\n",
      "<br/>Recut into a heart-like shape that\n",
      "became known as...\n",
      "<br/>...the Heart of the Ocean.\n",
      "<br/>Today it would be worth\n",
      "more than the Hope diamond.\n",
      "<br/>It was a dreadful,\n",
      "heavy thing.\n",
      "<br/>I only wore it this once.\n",
      "<br/>You actually think\n",
      "this is you, Nana?\n",
      "<br/>It is me, dear.\n",
      "<br/>Wasn't I a dish?\n",
      "<br/>I tracked it down\n",
      "through insurance records.\n",
      "<br/>An old claim that was settled\n",
      "under terms of absolute secrecy.\n",
      "<br/>Can you tell me who the\n",
      "claimant was, Rose?\n",
      "<br/>I should imagine someone\n",
      "named Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Nathan Hockley,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "<br/>Pittsburgh steel tycoon.\n",
      "<br/>The claim was for a\n",
      "diamond necklace his son...\n",
      "<br/>...Caledon, bought his fiancée.\n",
      "<br/>You.\n",
      "<br/>A week before he\n",
      "sailed on Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>And it was filed right\n",
      "after the sinking.\n",
      "<br/>So the diamond had to have\n",
      "gone down with the ship.\n",
      "<br/>You see the date?\n",
      "<br/>April 14, 1912\n",
      "<br/>Which means if your grandmother\n",
      "is who she says she is...\n",
      "<br/>...she was wearing the diamond\n",
      "the day the Titanic sank.\n",
      "<br/>And that makes you\n",
      "my new best friend.\n",
      "<br/>These are some of the things\n",
      "we recovered from your stateroom.\n",
      "<br/>This was mine.\n",
      "<br/>How extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>And it looks the same as it\n",
      "did the last time I saw it.\n",
      "<br/>The reflection has\n",
      "changed a bit.\n",
      "<br/>Are you ready to go\n",
      "back to Titanic?\n",
      "<br/>Okay, here we go.\n",
      "<br/>She hits the berg on\n",
      "the starboard side, right?\n",
      "<br/>She kind of bumps along...\n",
      "<br/>...punching holes like\n",
      "morse code...\n",
      "<br/>-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...\n",
      "<br/>...below the waterline.\n",
      "<br/>Then the forward compartments\n",
      "start to flood.\n",
      "<br/>Now, as the water\n",
      "level rises...\n",
      "<br/>...it spills over the\n",
      "watertight bulkheads...\n",
      "<br/>which, unfortunately, don't go\n",
      "any higher than E deck-\n",
      "<br/>So now as the\n",
      "bow goes down...\n",
      "<br/>...the stern rises up,\n",
      "slow at first...\n",
      "<br/>...then faster and faster...\n",
      "<br/>...until finally, she's got her whole\n",
      "ass sticking up in the air.\n",
      "<br/>And that's a big ass.\n",
      "<br/>We're talking\n",
      "20, 30,000 tons. Okay?\n",
      "<br/>And the hull's not designed\n",
      "to deal with that pressure.\n",
      "<br/>So, what happens?\n",
      "<br/>She splits, right\n",
      "down to the keel.\n",
      "<br/>And the stern...\n",
      "<br/>...falls back level.\n",
      "<br/>Then...\n",
      "<br/>...as the bow sinks...\n",
      "<br/>...it pulls the stern vertical...\n",
      "<br/>...and then finally detaches.\n",
      "<br/>Now the stern section just kind of bobs\n",
      "there like a cork for a couple of minutes...\n",
      "<br/>...floods, and finally goes\n",
      "under about 2:20 AM...\n",
      "<br/>...2 hours and 40 minutes\n",
      "after the collision.\n",
      "<br/>The bow section\n",
      "planes away...\n",
      "<br/>...landing about a\n",
      "half a mile away...\n",
      "<br/>...going 20, 30 knots when\n",
      "it hits the ocean floor.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty cool, huh?\n",
      "<br/>Thank you for that fine\n",
      "forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.\n",
      "<br/>Of course, the\n",
      "experience of it was...\n",
      "<br/>...somewhat different.\n",
      "<br/>Will you share it with us?\n",
      "<br/>I'm taking her to rest.\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, Nana.\n",
      "<br/>No!\n",
      "<br/>Give me the\n",
      "tape recorder.\n",
      "<br/>Tell us, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>It's been 84 years--\n",
      "<br/>It's okay. Just try\n",
      "to remember anything...\n",
      "<br/>...anything at all.\n",
      "<br/>Do you want to hear this\n",
      "or not, Mr. Lovett?\n",
      "<br/>It's been 84 years...\n",
      "<br/>...and I can still smell\n",
      "the fresh paint.\n",
      "<br/>The china had\n",
      "never been used.\n",
      "<br/>The sheets had\n",
      "never been slept in.\n",
      "<br/>Titanic was called\n",
      "the ship of dreams.\n",
      "<br/>And it was.\n",
      "<br/>It really was.\n",
      "<br/>All third-class\n",
      "passengers...\n",
      "<br/>...with a forward berth...\n",
      "<br/>...this way please!\n",
      "This queue!\n",
      "<br/>It's a big boat, huh?\n",
      "<br/>Daddy, it's a ship.\n",
      "<br/>You're right.\n",
      "<br/>I don't see what all\n",
      "the fuss is about.\n",
      "<br/>It doesn't look any bigger\n",
      "than the Mauretania.\n",
      "<br/>You can be blasé\n",
      "about some things, Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...but not about Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>It's over 100 feet longer\n",
      "than Mauretania...\n",
      "<br/>...and far more luxurious.\n",
      "<br/>Your daughter is far too\n",
      "difficult to impress, Ruth.\n",
      "<br/>So this is the ship they\n",
      "say is unsinkable.\n",
      "<br/>It is unsinkable.\n",
      "<br/>God Himself\n",
      "could not sink this ship--\n",

      "Bruce?\n",
      "<br/>Yes, actually.\n",
      "<br/>I wanted to convey sheer size.\n",

      "<br/>Freud? Who is he?\n",
      "Is he a passenger?\n",

      "<br/>Yeah. It's an Irish ship.\n",
      "<br/>Is English, no?\n",

      "<br/>I saw my whole life\n",
      "as if I'd already lived it.\n",
      "<br/>An endless parade\n",
      "of parties and cotillions...\n",
      "<br/>yachts and polo matches.\n",

      "- I'm a good swimmer.\n",

      "<br/>I remember when I was a kid,\n",

      "<br/>...out on Lake Wissota.\n",
      "<br/>Ice fishing is, you know, where you--\n",

      "<br/>Sorry.\n",
      "<br/>You just seem like, you know,\n",
      "kind of an indoor girl.\n",
      "<br/>Anyway, I...\n",

      "<br/>And I'm telling you...\n",
      "<br/>...water that cold,\n",
      "<br/>like right down there...\n",
      "<br/>...it hits you like 1000 knives\n",
      "stabbing you all over your body.\n",

      "<br/>Good for you, son.\n",

      "<br/>Of course.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Lovejoy,\n",
      "I think a 20 should do it.\n",

      "<br/>Rose is displeased.\n",
      "<br/>What to do?\n",

      "<br/>...standing in the middle\n",
      "of a crowded room...\n",
      "<br/>...screaming at the\n",
      "top of my lungs...\n",
      "<br/>...and no one\n",
      "even looks up.\n",
      "<br/>Do you love him?\n",
      "<br/>Pardon me?\n",
      "<br/>Do you love him?\n",
      "<br/>You're being very rude. You\n",
      "shouldn't be asking me this.\n",
      "<br/>Well, it's a simple question.\n",
      "Do you love the guy or not?\n",
      "<br/>This is not a suitable conversation.\n",
      "<br/>VVhy can't you just\n",
      "answer the question?\n",
      "<br/>This is absurd.\n",
      "<br/>You don't know me\n",
      "and I don't know you...\n",
      "<br/>...and we are not having this\n",
      "conversation at all. You are rude...\n",
      "<br/>...and uncouth and presumptuous\n",
      "and I am leaving now...\n",
      "<br/>...Jack. Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "It's been a pleasure.\n",
      "<br/>I sought you out to thank you\n",
      "and now I have thanked you.\n",
      "<br/>And you've insulted me.\n",
      "<br/>Well, you deserved it.\n",
      "<br/>- Right.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "<br/>I thought you were leaving.\n",
      "<br/>I am.\n",
      "<br/>You are so annoying.\n",
      "<br/>Wait.\n",
      "<br/>I don't have to leave. This is\n",
      "my part of the ship. You leave.\n",
      "<br/>Well, well, well.\n",
      "Now who's being rude?\n",
      "<br/>What is this stupid thing\n",
      "you're carrying around?\n",
      "<br/>So, what are you,\n",
      "an artist or something?\n",
      "<br/>These are rather good.\n",
      "<br/>They're very good, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, this is exquisite work.\n",
      "<br/>Ah, they didn't think too\n",
      "much of them in old Paree.\n",
      "<br/>Paris?\n",
      "<br/>You do get around\n",
      "for a p--\n",
      "<br/>Well, a-- a\n",
      "person of limited means.\n",
      "<br/>Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.\n",
      "<br/>Well, well, well.\n",
      "<br/>And these were drawn from life?\n",
      "<br/>Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.\n",
      "<br/>Lots of girls are willing\n",
      "to take their clothes off.\n",
      "<br/>You liked this woman.\n",
      "<br/>You used her several times.\n",
      "<br/>Well.\n",
      "<br/>She had beautiful\n",
      "hands, you see?\n",
      "<br/>I think you must have\n",
      "had a love affair with her.\n",
      "<br/>No, no, no.\n",
      "Just with her hands.\n",
      "<br/>She was a\n",
      "one-legged prostitute.\n",
      "<br/>See?\n",
      "<br/>She had a good\n",
      "sense of humor though.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, and this lady...\n",
      "<br/>She used to sit at this bar every night...\n",
      "<br/>...wearing every piece\n",
      "of jewelry she owned...\n",
      "<br/>...just waiting for\n",
      "her long, lost love.\n",
      "<br/>We called her Madame Bijoux.\n",
      "<br/>See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.\n",
      "<br/>Well,\n",
      "you have a gift, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>You do.\n",
      "<br/>You see people.\n",
      "<br/>I see you.\n",
      "<br/>And?\n",
      "<br/>You wouldn't have jumped.\n",
      "<br/>But the purpose of university\n",
      "is to find a suitable husband.\n",
      "<br/>Rose has already done that.\n",
      "<br/>Look, here comes that\n",
      "vulgar Brown woman.\n",
      "<br/>Quickly, get up before\n",
      "she sits with us.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, girls. I was hoping\n",
      "I'd catch you at tea.\n",
      "<br/>We're awfully sorry,\n",
      "you missed it.\n",
      "<br/>The Countess and I were just\n",
      "off to take the air on the boat deck.\n",
      "<br/>What a lovely idea.\n",
      "I need to catch up on my gossip.\n",
      "<br/>Countess.\n",
      "<br/>So, you've not yet lit the\n",
      "last four boilers?\n",
      "<br/>No, I don't see\n",
      "the need.\n",
      "<br/>We are making excellent time.\n",
      "<br/>The press knows the size of Titanic.\n",
      "Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.\n",
      "<br/>We must give them\n",
      "something new to print.\n",
      "<br/>This maiden voyage\n",
      "of Titanic must...\n",
      "<br/>...make headlines.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. lsmay, I would prefer\n",
      "not to push the engines...\n",
      "<br/>...until they've been properly run in.\n",
      "<br/>Of course I'm just a passenger.\n",
      "<br/>I leave it to your good offices\n",
      "to decide what's best.\n",
      "<br/>But what a glorious end to your final crossing...\n",
      "<br/>...if we were to get into New York\n",
      "on Tuesday night...\n",
      "<br/>...and surprise them all.\n",
      "Make the morning papers.\n",
      "<br/>Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?\n",
      "<br/>Good man.\n",
      "<br/>After that, I worked\n",
      "on a squid boat in Monterey...\n",
      "<br/>...then I went to Los Angeles to the...\n",
      "<br/>...Santa Monica pier\n",
      "and did portraits for 10 cents each.\n",
      "<br/>Why can't I be like you?\n",
      "<br/>Just head out for the horizon\n",
      "whenever I feel like it.\n",
      "<br/>Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...\n",
      "<br/>only if we just talk about it\n",
      "<br/>No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.\n",
      "<br/>Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up\n",
      "<br/>We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.\n",
      "<br/>But you have to do it like a real cowboy.\n",
      "No sidesaddle stuff.\n",
      "<br/>You mean with one leg on each side?\n",
      "<br/>Can you show me?\n",
      "<br/>Sure, if you like.\n",
      "<br/>Teach me to ride like a man.\n",
      "<br/>Chew tobacco like a man.\n",
      "<br/>And spit like a man.\n",
      "<br/>You didn't learn in finishing school?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, I'll show you.\n",
      "<br/>I'll show you how.\n",
      "<br/>Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.\n",
      "<br/>I couldn't possibly, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Watch closely.\n",
      "<br/>That's disgusting.\n",
      "<br/>Your turn\n",
      "<br/>That was pitiful.\n",
      "You really have to hawk it back.\n",
      "<br/>Get some leverage.\n",
      "Use your arms. Arc your neck.\n",
      "<br/>You see the range on that thing?\n",
      "<br/>Okay, go.\n",
      "<br/>That was better. You have to work on it.\n",
      "Really try to hawk it up.\n",
      "<br/>Mother.\n",
      "<br/>May I introduce Jack Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>Charmed, I'm sure.\n",
      "<br/>The others were gracious and curious\n",
      "about the man who'd saved my life.\n",
      "<br/>But my mother looked at him like an insect.\n",
      "<br/>A dangerous insect\n",
      "which must be squashed quickly.\n",
      "<br/>Sounds like you're a good man\n",
      "to have around in a sticky spot.\n",
      "<br/>Why do they always insist on announcing\n",
      "dinner like a damn cavalry charge?\n",
      "<br/>Shall we go dress, Mother?\n",
      "<br/>See you at dinner, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Uh, son?\n",
      "<br/>Son!\n",
      "<br/>Do you have any idea what you're doing?\n",
      "<br/>Not really.\n",
      "<br/>You're about to go into the snake pit.\n",
      "<br/>What are you going to wear?\n",
      "<br/>I figured. Come on.\n",
      "<br/>I was right. You and my son\n",
      "are just about the same size.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty close.\n",
      "<br/>You shine up like a new penny.\n",
      "<br/>Good evening, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Thousands of tons of Hockley steel\n",
      "are in this ship.\n",
      "<br/>- Which part?\n",
      "- All the right ones.\n",
      "<br/>Then you're accountable\n",
      "if there's a problem. Where's Rose?\n",
      "<br/>She'll be along.\n",
      "<br/>There is the Countess.\n",
      "<br/>I saw that in a nickelodeon\n",
      "and always wanted to do it.\n",
      "<br/>Darling...\n",
      "<br/>...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "<br/>It's amazing.\n",
      "You could almost pass for a gentleman.\n",
      "<br/>Almost.\n",
      "<br/>This is extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>This is a remarkable voyage.\n",
      "<br/>- Mad.\n",
      "- Completely lunatic.\n",
      "<br/>There's the Countess of Rothes.\n",
      "<br/>That's John Jacob Astor...\n",
      "<br/>...the richest man on board.\n",
      "<br/>His little wifey, Madeleine,\n",
      "is my age and in a delicate condition.\n",
      "<br/>See how she tries to hide it.\n",
      "<br/>Quite the scandal.\n",
      "<br/>Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,\n",
      "Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...\n",
      "<br/>...is at home with the children, of course.\n",
      "And over here...\n",
      "<br/>...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.\n",
      "<br/>She designs naughty lingerie,\n",
      "among her many talents.\n",
      "<br/>Very popular with the royals.\n",
      "<br/>Congratulations. She's splendid.\n",
      "<br/>Why, thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Escort a lady to dinner?\n",
      "<br/>Certainly.\n",
      "<br/>Sweet pea, sweet pea.\n",
      "<br/>Ain't nothing to it.\n",
      "<br/>They love money. Pretend like you own\n",
      "a gold mine and you're in the club.\n",
      "<br/>Hey, Astor.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.\n",
      "<br/>J.J., Madeleine,\n",
      "I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.\n",
      "<br/>Well, Jack...\n",
      "<br/>...are you of the Boston Dawsons?\n",
      "<br/>No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br/>He must have been nervous,\n",
      "but he never faltered.\n",
      "<br/>They assumed he was one of them.\n",
      "<br/>Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.\n",
      "<br/>New money, obviously,\n",
      "but still a member of the club.\n",
      "<br/>Mother, of course,\n",
      "could always be counted upon.\n",
      "<br/>Tell us of the accommodations in steerage\n",
      "Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good-\n",
      "<br/>The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.\n",
      "<br/>He was of help to my fiancée last night.\n",
      "<br/>It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.\n",
      "<br/>He showed me some of his work today.\n",
      "<br/>Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.\n",
      "Not to impugn your work, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Are all these mine?\n",
      "<br/>Start from the outside and work in.\n",
      "<br/>He knows every rivet in her.\n",
      "<br/>Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>How do you take your caviar, sir?\n",
      "<br/>No caviar for me, thanks.\n",
      "Never did like it much.\n",
      "<br/>Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>After that, I'm on God's good humor.\n",
      "<br/>How do you have means to travel?\n",
      "<br/>I work my way from place to place.\n",
      "Tramp steamers and such.\n",
      "<br/>I won my ticket on Titanic\n",
      "at a lucky hand at poker.\n",
      "<br/>A very lucky hand.\n",
      "<br/>All life is a game of luck.\n",
      "<br/>A real man makes his own luck.\n",
      "Right, Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>And you find\n",
      "that sort of rootless existence appealing?\n",
      "<br/>Yes, ma'am, I do.\n",
      "<br/>I've got everything I need\n",
      "right here with me.\n",
      "<br/>I have air in my lungs\n",
      "and blank sheets of paper.\n",
      "<br/>I love waking up, not knowing\n",
      "what will happen or who I'll meet.\n",
      "<br/>Where I'll wind up.\n",
      "<br/>One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...\n",
      "<br/>...now I'm on the grandest ship\n",
      "in the world, with you fine people.\n",
      "<br/>I'll take more of that.\n",
      "<br/>Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.\n",
      "<br/>You never know what hand you'll get dealt.\n",
      "<br/>You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.\n",
      "<br/>Make each day count.\n",
      "<br/>Well said, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Hear, hear.\n",
      "<br/>To making it count.\n",
      "<br/>To making it count.\n",
      "<br/>Bravo.\n",
      "<br/>But Mr. Brown didn't know\n",
      "I'd hidden the money in the stove.\n",
      "<br/>He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating\n",
      "and lights a fire.\n",
      "<br/>Next is brandy in the smoking room.\n",
      "<br/>Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?\n",
      "<br/>Now they retreat to congratulate each\n",
      "other on being masters of the universe.\n",
      "<br/>Ladies, thank you for your company.\n",
      "<br/>May I escort you to the cabin?\n",
      "<br/>No, I'll stay here.\n",
      "<br/>Here, Molly.\n",
      "<br/>Joining us, Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>You don't want to stay with the women.\n",
      "<br/>No, thanks. I have to head back.\n",
      "<br/>That's best. It'll be all business and politics.\n",
      "Wouldn't interest you.\n",
      "<br/>But Dawson, good of you to come.\n",
      "<br/>Must you go?\n",
      "<br/>Time for me to row with the other slaves.\n",
      "<br/>Good night, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Want to go to a real party?\n",
      "<br/>Is okay I put my hand here?\n",
      "<br/>I can't understand you.\n",
      "<br/>I'm going to dance with her now.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>Come on. Come with me.\n",
      "<br/>Jack. Jack, wait.\n",
      "<br/>I can't do this.\n",
      "<br/>We'll have to get a bit closer.\n",
      "<br/>Like this.\n",
      "<br/>You're still my best girl, Cora.\n",
      "<br/>- I don't know the steps.\n",
      "- Me, either. Just go with it.\n",
      "<br/>Don't think.\n",
      "<br/>Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!\n",
      "<br/>Wh at? Wait!\n",
      "<br/>Jack, no.\n",
      "<br/>--Beyond the jurisdiction\n",
      "of the Sherman Act.\n",
      "<br/>That's what Rockefeller said--\n",
      "Supreme Court didn't swallow it.\n",
      "<br/>What? You think\n",
      "a first-class girl can't drink?\n",
      "<br/>Get out of here.\n",
      "<br/>Are you all right?\n",
      "<br/>I'm fine.\n",
      "<br/>Two out of three.\n",
      "<br/>So...\n",
      "<br/>...you think you're tough?\n",
      "<br/>Let's see you do this.\n",
      "<br/>Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.\n",
      "<br/>Jesus!\n",
      "<br/>You okay?\n",
      "<br/>I haven't done that in years.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go.\n",
      "<br/>Coffee, sir?\n",
      "<br/>You didn't come to me last night.\n",
      "<br/>I was tired.\n",
      "<br/>Your exertions below deck\n",
      "were no doubt exhausting.\n",
      "<br/>I see you had\n",
      "that undertaker of a manservant follow me.\n",
      "<br/>You will never behave like that again.\n",
      "<br/>I'm not one of your mill foremen\n",
      "who you can command.\n",
      "<br/>I'm your fiancée.\n",
      "<br/>My fiancée. My fiancée!\n",
      "<br/>Yes, you are! And my wife!\n",
      "<br/>My wife in practice,\n",
      "if not yet by law, so you will honor me!\n",
      "<br/>You will honor me the way\n",
      "a wife honors her husband.\n",
      "<br/>Because I will not be made a fool of.\n",
      "<br/>Is this in any way unclear?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Good. Excuse me.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, Miss Rose.\n",
      "<br/>We had a little accident.\n",
      "<br/>- That's all right.\n",
      "- I'm sorry.\n",
      "<br/>Let me help you.\n",
      "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br/>Tea, Trudy.\n",
      "<br/>You're not to see that boy again.\n",
      "You understand?\n",
      "<br/>Rose, I forbid it.\n",
      "<br/>Stop it, Mother.\n",
      "You'll give yourself a nosebleed.\n",
      "<br/>This is not a game.\n",
      "<br/>Our situation is precarious.\n",
      "You know the money's gone.\n",
      "<br/>Of course I know.\n",
      "You remind me every day.\n",
      "<br/>Your father left us nothing but a legacy\n",
      "of bad debts hidden by a good name.\n",
      "<br/>That name is the only card we have to play.\n",
      "<br/>I don't understand you.\n",
      "<br/>It is a fine match with Hockley.\n",
      "It will ensure our survival.\n",
      "<br/>How can you put this on me?\n",
      "<br/>Why are you being so selfish?\n",
      "<br/>I'm being selfish?\n",
      "<br/>Do you want to see me\n",
      "working as a seamstress?\n",
      "<br/>Is that what you want?\n",
      "<br/>To see our fine things sold at auction?\n",
      "<br/>Our memories scattered?\n",
      "<br/>It's so unfair.\n",
      "<br/>Of course it's unfair.\n",
      "<br/>We're women.\n",
      "<br/>Our choices are never easy.\n",
      "<br/>Protect them by Thy guiding hand\n",
      "<br/>From every peril on the land\n",
      "<br/>O, spirit whom the Father sent\n",
      "<br/>To spread abroad the firmament\n",
      "<br/>O, wind of heaven, by Thy might\n",
      "<br/>Save all who dare the eagle 's ﬂight\n",
      "<br/>And keep them by Thy watchful care...\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>I need to talk to someone.\n",
      "<br/>You're not supposed to be in here.\n",
      "<br/>I was here last night, remember?\n",
      "<br/>No. Now please turn around.\n",
      "<br/>He'll tell you. I just need to talk--\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...\n",
      "<br/>...are still appreciative of your assistance.\n",
      "<br/>They asked me\n",
      "to give you this in gratitude--\n",
      "<br/>I don't want your money.\n",
      "<br/>--And remind you you are\n",
      "in third class and your presence here...\n",
      "<br/>...is no longer appropriate.\n",
      "<br/>Let me speak to Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson\n",
      "returns to where he belongs...\n",
      "<br/>...and that he stays there?\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Come along, you.\n",
      "<br/>Hear us when we cry to Thee\n",
      "<br/>For those in peril on the sea\n",
      "<br/>Why are there two steering wheels?\n",
      "<br/>We use this one near shore.\n",
      "<br/>Excuse me, sir.\n",
      "Another ice warning, from the Noordam.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Sparks.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry.\n",
      "Quite normal for this time of year.\n",
      "<br/>In fact, we're speeding up.\n",
      "I've ordered the last boilers lit.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, son, wind it up tight\n",
      "like I showed you. That's right.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, now let it go.\n",
      "<br/>- It was good, wasn't it?\n",
      "- Quite nice. That's excellent.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Andrews...Forgive me.\n",
      "<br/>I did the sum\n",
      "in my head...\n",
      "<br/>...and with the number of lifeboats\n",
      "times the capacity you mentioned...\n",
      "<br/>Forgive me, but it seems that there are\n",
      "not enough for everyone aboard.\n",
      "<br/>About half, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Rose, you miss nothing,\n",
      "do you?\n",
      "<br/>In fact, I put in these new\n",
      "type davits...\n",
      "<br/>...which can take an extra row\n",
      "of boats inside this one.\n",
      "<br/>But it was thought,\n",
      "by some...\n",
      "<br/>...the deck would look\n",
      "too cluttered.\n",
      "<br/>So, I was overruled.\n",
      "<br/>It's a waste of deck space\n",
      "as it is on an unsinkable ship.\n",
      "<br/>Sleep soundly, young Rose.\n",
      "<br/>I have built you a good ship,\n",
      "strong and true.\n",
      "<br/>She's all the lifeboat\n",
      "you need.\n",
      "<br/>Just keep heading aft. The next\n",
      "stop will be the engine room.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, this is impossible.\n",
      "I can't see you.\n",
      "<br/>- I need to talk to you.\n",
      "- No, Jack. No.\n",
      "<br/>Jack.\n",
      "I'm engaged.\n",
      "<br/>I'm marrying Cal.\n",
      "<br/>I love Cal.\n",
      "<br/>Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...you're no picnic. All right?\n",
      "You're a spoiled little brat even.\n",
      "<br/>But under that, you're the\n",
      "most amazingly, astounding\n",
      "<br/>...wonderful girl...\n",
      "<br/>...woman, that I've ever known.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, I--\n",
      "<br/>No, let me try and get\n",
      "this out. You're ama--\n",
      "<br/>I'm not an idiot.\n",
      "I know how the world works.\n",
      "<br/>I've got ten bucks\n",
      "in my pocket.\n",
      "<br/>I have nothing to offer\n",
      "you and I know that.\n",
      "<br/>I understand.\n",
      "<br/>But I'm too involved now.\n",
      "<br/>You jump, I jump\n",
      "Remember?\n",
      "<br/>I can't turn away without\n",
      "knowing you'll be all right.\n",
      "<br/>That's all that I want.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I'm fine.\n",
      "<br/>I'll be fine. Really.\n",
      "<br/>Really?\n",
      "<br/>I don't think so.\n",
      "<br/>They've got you trapped, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>And you're gonna die if you\n",
      "don't break free.\n",
      "<br/>Maybe not right away...\n",
      "<br/>...because you're strong...\n",
      "<br/>...but sooner or later that\n",
      "fire that I love about you, Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...that fire is gonna\n",
      "burn out.\n",
      "<br/>It's not up to you\n",
      "to save me, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>You're right.\n",
      "<br/>Only you can do that.\n",
      "<br/>I'm going back.\n",
      "<br/>Leave me alone.\n",
      "<br/>Tell Lucile about the disaster\n",
      "you had with the stationers.\n",
      "<br/>Well, of course the invitations\n",
      "had to be sent back, twice.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, my dear.\n",
      "<br/>And the dreadful\n",
      "bridesmaids' gowns.\n",
      "<br/>Let me tell you what an\n",
      "odyssey that has been.\n",
      "<br/>Rose decided she\n",
      "wanted lavender.\n",
      "<br/>She knows I detest the color.\n",
      "<br/>So, she did it only to spite me.\n",
      "<br/>If only you'd come to\n",
      "me sooner.\n",
      "<br/>Ruth saw some of my designs in\n",
      "La Mode Illustrée.\n",
      "<br/>They were for the trousseau of the Duchess\n",
      "of Marlborough's youngest daughter.\n",
      "<br/>They were quite charming.\n",
      "<br/>But, I think you'll agree,\n",
      "my dear, that together...\n",
      "<br/>...we've created something\n",
      "of a phoenix from the ashes.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>I changed my mind.\n",
      "<br/>They said you might be up here.\n",
      "<br/>Give me your hand.\n",
      "<br/>Now close your eyes.\n",
      "<br/>Go on.\n",
      "<br/>Now, step up.\n",
      "<br/>Now, hold onto the railing.\n",
      "<br/>Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "Don't peek.\n",
      "<br/>I'm not.\n",
      "<br/>Now, step up onto the rail.\n",
      "<br/>Hold on. Hold on.\n",
      "<br/>Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "<br/>Do you trust me?\n",
      "<br/>I trust you.\n",
      "<br/>All right...\n",
      "<br/>---Open your eyes.\n",
      "<br/>I'm flying.\n",
      "<br/>Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Come, Josephine, in my\n",
      "ﬂying machine. Going up...\n",
      "<br/>...she goes. Up she goes.\n",
      "<br/>That was the last time\n",
      "Titanic ever saw daylight.\n",
      "<br/>We're up to dusk the\n",
      "night of the sinking.\n",
      "<br/>6 hours to go.\n",
      "<br/>Incredible. There's Smith and\n",
      "he's standing there and...\n",
      "<br/>...he's got the iceberg warning\n",
      "in his fucking hand...\n",
      "<br/>...excuse me--his hand,\n",
      "and he's ordering more speed.\n",
      "<br/>26 years of experience\n",
      "working against him.\n",
      "<br/>He figures anything big\n",
      "enough to sink, the ship...\n",
      "<br/>...they're gonna see in time to turn.\n",
      "<br/>But the ship's too big\n",
      "with too small a rudder.\n",
      "<br/>Doesn't corner worth a damn.\n",
      "<br/>Everything he knows\n",
      "is wrong.\n",
      "<br/>It's quite proper, I assure you.\n",
      "This is the sitting room.\n",
      "<br/>- Will this light do?\n",
      "- What?\n",
      "<br/>Don't artists need good light?\n",
      "<br/>That is true, but I'm not\n",
      "used to working in...\n",
      "<br/>...such horrible conditions.\n",
      "<br/>Monet!\n",
      "<br/>- Do you know his work?\n",
      "- Of course.\n",
      "<br/>Look at his use of color here.\n",
      "Isn't he great?\n",
      "<br/>I know. It's extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>Cal insists on carting\n",
      "this hideous thing everywhere.\n",
      "<br/>Should we be expecting him\n",
      "any time soon?\n",
      "<br/>Not as long as the cigars\n",
      "and brandy hold out.\n",
      "<br/>That's nice.\n",
      "<br/>What is it,\n",
      "a sapphire?\n",
      "<br/>A diamond.\n",
      "<br/>A very rare diamond.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, I want you to draw me\n",
      "like one of your French girls.\n",
      "<br/>Wearing this.\n",
      "<br/>All right.\n",
      "<br/>Wearing only this.\n",
      "<br/>The last thing I need is another picture of me\n",
      "looking like a porcelain doll.\n",
      "<br/>As a paying customer...\n",
      "<br/>...I expect to get\n",
      "what I want.\n",
      "<br/>Over on the bed\n",
      "...uh, the couch.\n",
      "<br/>Come. Lie down.\n",
      "<br/>- Tell me when it looks right.\n",
      "- Keep that.\n",
      "<br/>Put your arm back\n",
      "the way it was.\n",
      "<br/>Put that other arm up,\n",
      "that hand right by your face there.\n",
      "<br/>Right.\n",
      "<br/>Now, head down.\n",
      "<br/>Eyes to me.\n",
      "Keep them on me.\n",
      "<br/>And try to stay still.\n",
      "<br/>So serious.\n",
      "<br/>I believe you are blushing,\n",
      "Mr. Big Artiste.\n",
      "<br/>I can't imagine\n",
      "Monsieur Monet blushing.\n",
      "<br/>He does landscapes.\n",
      "<br/>- Just relax your face.\n",
      "- Sorry.\n",
      "<br/>No laughing.\n",
      "<br/>My heart was pounding\n",
      "the whole time.\n",
      "<br/>It was the most erotic\n",
      "moment of my life...\n",
      "<br/>...up until then, at least.\n",
      "<br/>So what happened next?\n",
      "<br/>You mean,\n",
      "did we do it?\n",
      "<br/>Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.\n",
      "<br/>Jack was very professional.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>What are you doing?\n",
      "<br/>Will you put this\n",
      "back in the safe for me?\n",
      "<br/>Gentlemen, would you excuse me.\n",
      "<br/>None of the stewards\n",
      "have seen her.\n",
      "<br/>This is absurd.\n",
      "It's a ship.\n",
      "<br/>There's only so many\n",
      "places she could be.\n",
      "<br/>Lovejoy, find her.\n",
      "<br/>- Clear.\n",
      "- Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I don't think I've ever\n",
      "seen such a flat calm.\n",
      "<br/>Like a mill pond.\n",
      "<br/>Not a breath of wind.\n",
      "<br/>It will make the bergs\n",
      "harder to see---\n",
      "<br/>...with no breaking\n",
      "water at the base.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I'm off.\n",
      "<br/>Maintain speed and\n",
      "heading, Mr. Lightoller.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>It's getting cold.\n",
      "You look nice.\n",
      "<br/>Miss Rose?\n",
      "<br/>My drawings!\n",
      "<br/>Come on!\n",
      "<br/>Wait, wait, wait!\n",
      "<br/>Wait, wait, wait!\n",
      "<br/>- Go. Go. Down, down.\n",
      "- Take us down, quickly. Quickly!\n",
      "<br/>Bye.\n",
      "<br/>Sorry.\n",
      "<br/>- Keep going.\n",
      "- Thank you, I've got it.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty tough for\n",
      "a valet, this fella.\n",
      "<br/>Seems more like a cop.\n",
      "<br/>I think he was.\n",
      "<br/>- Oh, shit.\n",
      "- Go!\n",
      "<br/>No, over here!\n",
      "<br/>Quick!\n",
      "<br/>Now what?\n",
      "<br/>Wh at?\n",
      "<br/>More coal for number\n",
      "one, mate.\n",
      "<br/>Hold up? What are you two\n",
      "doing down here?\n",
      "<br/>You shouldn't be down here.\n",
      "<br/>It could be dangerous!\n",
      "<br/>Carry on!\n",
      "<br/>Don't mind us. You're\n",
      "doing a great job!\n",
      "<br/>Keep up the good work!\n",
      "<br/>Look at what we have here, huh?\n",
      "<br/>Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Where to, miss?\n",
      "<br/>To the stars.\n",
      "<br/>You nervous?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Put your hands on me, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>It's bloody cold.\n",
      "<br/>You know, I can smell ice, you know.\n",
      "When it's near.\n",
      "<br/>Bollocks!\n",
      "<br/>Well, I can, all right?\n",
      "<br/>Did you ever find those\n",
      "binoculars for the lookouts?\n",
      "<br/>Haven't seen them\n",
      "since Southampton.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I'll be on\n",
      "my rounds.\n",
      "<br/>Cheerio.\n",
      "<br/>You're trembling.\n",
      "<br/>Don't worry.\n",
      "<br/>I'll be all right.\n",
      "<br/>- They ran down there.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "<br/>Anything missing?\n",
      "<br/>I have a better idea.\n",
      "<br/>GOI you!\n",
      "<br/>Did you see those guys' faces?\n",
      "<br/>Did you see them?\n",
      "<br/>When the ship docks...\n",
      "<br/>...I'm getting off with you.\n",
      "<br/>This is crazy.\n",
      "<br/>I know. It doesn't make any sense.\n",
      "<br/>That's why I trust it.\n",
      "<br/>Here, look at this.\n",
      "<br/>Look at that, would you?\n",
      "<br/>They're warmer than we are.\n",
      "<br/>If that's what it takes for us to get warm,\n",
      "I'd rather not.\n",
      "<br/>Bugger me!\n",
      "<br/>Pick up, you bastards!\n",
      "<br/>Is anyone there?!\n",
      "<br/>What do you see?\n",
      "<br/>Iceberg, right ahead!\n",
      "<br/>Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Iceberg ahead!\n",
      "<br/>Hard a' starboard!\n",
      "<br/>Turn! Turn! Srnartly!\n",
      "<br/>Full astern!\n",
      "<br/>Hard over.\n",
      "<br/>Helm's hard over, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Go, lads, go!\n",
      "<br/>Bring that steam down! Bring it down!\n",
      "<br/>Shut all the dampers! Shut them!\n",
      "<br/>Hold it.\n",
      "<br/>Hold it!\n",
      "<br/>Now! Engage reversing engine!\n",
      "<br/>Why ain't they turning?\n",
      "<br/>Is it hard over?!\n",
      "<br/>It is, sir. Hard over.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, come on, come on. Turn.\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>It's going to hit!\n",
      "<br/>Jesus Christ!\n",
      "<br/>Jesus!\n",
      "<br/>Hard to port!\n",
      "<br/>Hard to port!\n",
      "<br/>Get back!\n",
      "<br/>Let's go!\n",
      "<br/>They're closing the doors! Get out!\n",
      "<br/>Get out the door! Go!\n",
      "<br/>Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!\n",
      "<br/>Go! Go!\n",
      "<br/>Out! Out!\n",
      "<br/>Oh, my God.\n",
      "<br/>That was a close shave.\n",
      "<br/>Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!\n",
      "<br/>Note the time. Enter it in the log.\n",
      "<br/>What was that, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br/>An iceberg, sir.\n",
      "<br/>I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close.\n",
      "<br/>I tried to port round it, but--\n",
      "<br/>- Close the watertight doors.\n",
      "- They're closed, sir.\n",
      "<br/>All stop.\n",
      "<br/>Have the carpenter sound the ship.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, let's get the hell out of here!\n",
      "<br/>Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.\n",
      "<br/>That's the shudder you felt.\n",
      "Do you need anything?\n",
      "<br/>No, thank you.\n",
      "<br/>There's talk of an iceberg.\n",
      "<br/>I don't see anything. Do you?\n",
      "<br/>If this is where the rats are going, I am, too.\n",
      "<br/>- You.\n",
      "- There is no emergency.\n",
      "<br/>- There is. I've been robbed.\n",
      "- Get the Master at Arms.\n",
      "<br/>Now, you moron!\n",
      "<br/>Did I miss the fun?\n",
      "<br/>- Did you see what happened?\n",
      "- No- I guess it hit over there-\n",
      "<br/>Boiler room six is flooded eight feet\n",
      "and the mail hold is worse.\n",
      "<br/>- Can you shore up?\n",
      "- Not unless the pumps get ahead.\n",
      "<br/>- Have you seen the mail hold?\n",
      "- It's already underwater.\n",
      "<br/>This is bad.\n",
      "<br/>We should tell Mother and Cal.\n",
      "<br/>I think they're very good, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Don't touch anything.\n",
      "I want the room photographed.\n",
      "<br/>We've been looking for you, miss.\n",
      "<br/>Here we go.\n",
      "<br/>Something serious has happened.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, it has.\n",
      "<br/>Indeed.\n",
      "Two things dear to me have disappeared.\n",
      "<br/>Now that one is back,\n",
      "I know where to find the other. Search him.\n",
      "<br/>- Take your coat off.\n",
      "- Now what?\n",
      "<br/>What are you doing?\n",
      "We're in the middle of an emergency.\n",
      "<br/>- Is this it?\n",
      "- That's it.\n",
      "<br/>This is horseshit!\n",
      "<br/>Don't you believe it.\n",
      "<br/>- He couldn't have.\n",
      "- Easy enough for a professional.\n",
      "<br/>I was with him the entire time.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps he did it while you were putting\n",
      "your clothes back on, dear.\n",
      "<br/>Real slick. They put it in my pocket.\n",
      "<br/>- Shut up.\n",
      "- It isn't even your pocket.\n",
      "<br/>\"Property of A.L. Ryerson.\"\n",
      "<br/>That was reported stolen.\n",
      "<br/>I just borrowed it.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, we have an honest thief.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do this, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Don't believe them. You know it.\n",
      "<br/>Let's go, son.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do it!\n",
      "<br/>There's a good lad. Come on.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do it! You know me!\n",
      "<br/>This is most unfortunate, Captain.\n",
      "<br/>Water fourteen feet above the keel\n",
      "in ten minutes...\n",
      "<br/>...in the forepeak,\n",
      "all three holds and boiler room six.\n",
      "<br/>That's right.\n",
      "<br/>When can we get underway?\n",
      "<br/>That's five compartments.\n",
      "<br/>She can float with four compartments breached,\n",
      "but not five.\n",
      "<br/>Not five. As she goes down,\n",
      "the water will spill...\n",
      "<br/>...over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,\n",
      "one to the next...\n",
      "<br/>...back and back. There's no stopping it.\n",
      "<br/>The pumps.\n",
      "<br/>The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.\n",
      "<br/>As of now, no matter what we do...\n",
      "<br/>...Titanic will founder.\n",
      "<br/>But this ship can't sink.\n",
      "<br/>She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.\n",
      "<br/>And she will.\n",
      "<br/>It's a mathematical certainty.\n",
      "<br/>How much time?\n",
      "<br/>An hour. Two, at most.\n",
      "<br/>How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br/>Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I believe you may get your headlines,\n",
      "Mr. lsmay.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?\n",
      "<br/>Look at me when I'm talking to you!\n",
      "<br/>- Mr. Hockley?\n",
      "- Not now. We're busy.\n",
      "<br/>You've been asked to put on lifebelts\n",
      "and go to the boat deck.\n",
      "<br/>I said, not now.\n",
      "<br/>I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.\n",
      "Dress warmly.\n",
      "<br/>It's quite cold out.\n",
      "<br/>May I suggest topcoats and hats?\n",
      "<br/>This is ridiculous.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry, miss.\n",
      "I'm sure it's just a precaution.\n",
      "<br/>Everybody up! Lifebelts on!\n",
      "<br/>What's he on about?\n",
      "<br/>- Put your lifebelts on!\n",
      "- What is it?\n",
      "<br/>Just put them on.\n",
      "<br/>C.O.D.?\n",
      "<br/>Sir?\n",
      "<br/>That's right, C.O.D. The distress call.\n",
      "That's our position.\n",
      "<br/>Tell whoever responds we're going down\n",
      "and need immediate assistance.\n",
      "<br/>Blimey.\n",
      "<br/>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br/>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br/>Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!\n",

      "<br/>They went inside- Too cold and noisy for them\n",

      "and help with these lines!\n",
      "<br/>Care for a drink, sir?\n",
      "<br/>Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed up\n",
      "and now we're cooling our heels.\n",
      "<br/>Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.\n",
      "<br/>Nobody knows what's going on.\n",
      "<br/>Just like the damn English--everything by the book.\n",
      "<br/>No need for language, Mr. Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.\n",
      "I want a cup of tea when I return.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.\n",

      "<br/>The ship will sink.\n",
      "<br/>You're certain?\n",
      "<br/>In an hour or so, all this\n",

      "<br/>Please, tell only who you must.\n",
      "I don't want to cause a panic.\n",
      "<br/>And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.\n",
      "<br/>You remember what I told you about the boats?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I understand.\n",
      "<br/>Over here, son.\n",
      "<br/>Sir, there's a big mob\n",
      "at the Second Class Purser's office.\n",
      "<br/>Go on. I'll watch him.\n",
      "<br/>Aye. Right.\n",
      "<br/>Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.\n",
      "Full steam for them, sir.\n",
      "<br/>She's the only one responding?\n",
      "<br/>The only one close. They'll be here in four hours.\n",
      "<br/>Four hours?!\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Bride.\n",
      "<br/>My God.\n",
      "<br/>We are swung out and ready, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Hadn't we better get the women and children\n",
      "into the boats?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>Women and children first, yes.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!\n",
      "<br/>Step this way, please. That's right.\n",
      "<br/>Come towards me. Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Good.\n",
      "<br/>For the time being,\n",
      "I require only women and children\n",
      "<br/>Right here.\n",
      "<br/>Like the Captain said,\n",
      "nice and cheery, so there's no panic.\n",
      "<br/>\"Wedding Dance.\"\n",
      "<br/>Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.\n",
      "<br/>Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.\n",
      "<br/>Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around.\n",
      "<br/>It isn't time to go to the boats yet!\n",
      "<br/>Please, stay calm.\n",
      "<br/>Make sure you have your lifebelts on.\n",
      "<br/>Let women and children through to the front.\n",
      "<br/>What are we doing?\n",
      "<br/>Waiting. Once first-class people\n",
      "are in the boats...\n",
      "<br/>...they'll start with us and we want to be ready.\n",
      "<br/>Pushing won't get you out any faster.\n",
      "<br/>Go get help.\n",
      "<br/>Lower it away, left and right together! Steady.\n",
      "<br/>Both sides together! Steady!\n",

      "<br/>Come on, sister, you heard\n",
      "the man. Into the boat.\n",
      "<br/>Any room for a gentleman,\n",
      "gentlemen?\n",
      "<br/>Only women at this time, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Will the lifeboats be\n",
      "seated according to class?\n",
      "<br/>I hope they're not too crowded.\n",

      "<br/>Don't you understand?\n",

Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi win third-class tickets to the ship in a game.

      "<br/>Hey!\n",
      "<br/>Are your staterooms\n",
      "all right?\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br/>Very nice.\n",
      "<br/>Have you met my\n",
      "granddaughter, Lizzy?\n",
      "<br/>She takes care of me.\n",
      "<br/>We met just a few\n",
      "minutes ago.\n",
      "<br/>Remember, Nana?\n",
      "Up on deck?\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br/>There. That's nice.\n",
      "<br/>Have to have my\n",
      "pictures when I travel.\n",
      "<br/>Can I get you anything?\n",
      "<br/>Is there anything you'd like?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I would like to\n",
      "see my drawing.\n",
      "<br/>Louis XVI wore a fabulous\n",
      "stone that was...\n",
      "<br/>...called the Blue Diamond\n",
      "of the Crown...\n",
      "<br/>...which disappeared\n",
      "in 1792...\n",
      "<br/>...about the same time old Louis lost\n",
      "everything from the neck up.\n",
      "<br/>The theory goes that the\n",
      "crown diamond was chopped, too.\n",
      "<br/>Recut into a heart-like shape that\n",
      "became known as...\n",
      "<br/>...the Heart of the Ocean.\n",
      "<br/>Today it would be worth\n",
      "more than the Hope diamond.\n",
      "<br/>It was a dreadful,\n",
      "heavy thing.\n",
      "<br/>I only wore it this once.\n",
      "<br/>You actually think\n",
      "this is you, Nana?\n",
      "<br/>It is me, dear.\n",
      "<br/>Wasn't I a dish?\n",
      "<br/>I tracked it down\n",
      "through insurance records.\n",
      "<br/>An old claim that was settled\n",
      "under terms of absolute secrecy.\n",
      "<br/>Can you tell me who the\n",
      "claimant was, Rose?\n",
      "<br/>I should imagine someone\n",
      "named Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Nathan Hockley,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "<br/>Pittsburgh steel tycoon.\n",
      "<br/>The claim was for a\n",
      "diamond necklace his son...\n",
      "<br/>...Caledon, bought his fiancée.\n",
      "<br/>You.\n",
      "<br/>A week before he\n",
      "sailed on Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>And it was filed right\n",
      "after the sinking.\n",
      "<br/>So the diamond had to have\n",
      "gone down with the ship.\n",
      "<br/>You see the date?\n",
      "<br/>April 14, 1912\n",
      "<br/>Which means if your grandmother\n",
      "is who she says she is...\n",
      "<br/>...she was wearing the diamond\n",
      "the day the Titanic sank.\n",
      "<br/>And that makes you\n",
      "my new best friend.\n",
      "<br/>These are some of the things\n",
      "we recovered from your stateroom.\n",
      "<br/>This was mine.\n",
      "<br/>How extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>And it looks the same as it\n",
      "did the last time I saw it.\n",
      "<br/>The reflection has\n",
      "changed a bit.\n",
      "<br/>Are you ready to go\n",
      "back to Titanic?\n",
      "<br/>Okay, here we go.\n",
      "<br/>She hits the berg on\n",
      "the starboard side, right?\n",
      "<br/>She kind of bumps along...\n",
      "<br/>...punching holes like\n",
      "morse code...\n",
      "<br/>-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...\n",
      "<br/>...below the waterline.\n",
      "<br/>Then the forward compartments\n",
      "start to flood.\n",
      "<br/>Now, as the water\n",
      "level rises...\n",
      "<br/>...it spills over the\n",
      "watertight bulkheads...\n",
      "<br/>which, unfortunately, don't go\n",
      "any higher than E deck-\n",
      "<br/>So now as the\n",
      "bow goes down...\n",
      "<br/>...the stern rises up,\n",
      "slow at first...\n",
      "<br/>...then faster and faster...\n",
      "<br/>...until finally, she's got her whole\n",
      "ass sticking up in the air.\n",
      "<br/>And that's a big ass.\n",
      "<br/>We're talking\n",
      "20, 30,000 tons. Okay?\n",
      "<br/>And the hull's not designed\n",
      "to deal with that pressure.\n",
      "<br/>So, what happens?\n",
      "<br/>She splits, right\n",
      "down to the keel.\n",
      "<br/>And the stern...\n",
      "<br/>...falls back level.\n",
      "<br/>Then...\n",
      "<br/>...as the bow sinks...\n",
      "<br/>...it pulls the stern vertical...\n",
      "<br/>...and then finally detaches.\n",
      "<br/>Now the stern section just kind of bobs\n",
      "there like a cork for a couple of minutes...\n",
      "<br/>...floods, and finally goes\n",
      "under about 2:20 AM...\n",
      "<br/>...2 hours and 40 minutes\n",
      "after the collision.\n",
      "<br/>The bow section\n",
      "planes away...\n",
      "<br/>...landing about a\n",
      "half a mile away...\n",
      "<br/>...going 20, 30 knots when\n",
      "it hits the ocean floor.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty cool, huh?\n",
      "<br/>Thank you for that fine\n",
      "forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.\n",
      "<br/>Of course, the\n",
      "experience of it was...\n",
      "<br/>...somewhat different.\n",
      "<br/>Will you share it with us?\n",
      "<br/>I'm taking her to rest.\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, Nana.\n",
      "<br/>No!\n",
      "<br/>Give me the\n",
      "tape recorder.\n",
      "<br/>Tell us, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>It's been 84 years--\n",
      "<br/>It's okay. Just try\n",
      "to remember anything...\n",
      "<br/>...anything at all.\n",
      "<br/>Do you want to hear this\n",
      "or not, Mr. Lovett?\n",
      "<br/>It's been 84 years...\n",
      "<br/>...and I can still smell\n",
      "the fresh paint.\n",
      "<br/>The china had\n",
      "never been used.\n",
      "<br/>The sheets had\n",
      "never been slept in.\n",
      "<br/>Titanic was called\n",

      "<br/>It's a big boat, huh?\n",
      "<br/>Daddy, it's a ship.\n",
      "<br/>You're right.\n",
      "<br/>I don't see what all\n",
      "the fuss is about.\n",
      "<br/>It doesn't look any bigger\n",
      "than the Mauretania.\n",
      "<br/>You can be blasé\n",
      "about some things, Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...but not about Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>It's over 100 feet longer\n",
      "than Mauretania...\n",
      "<br/>...and far more luxurious.\n",
      "<br/>Your daughter is far too\n",
      "difficult to impress, Ruth.\n",

      "<br/>It is unsinkable.\n",

      "at a great precipice...\n",
      "<br/>...with no one to pull me back.\n",
      "No one who cared...\n",
      "<br/>...or even noticed.\n",
      "<br/>Don't do it.\n",
      "<br/>Stay back.\n",
      "<br/>Don't come any closer.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>Just give me your hand.\n",
      "I'll pull you back over.\n",
      "<br/>No!\n",
      "Stay where you are.\n",
      "<br/>I mean it.\n",
      "<br/>I'll let go.\n",
      "<br/>No, you won't.\n",
      "<br/>What do you mean,\n",
      "no I won't?\n",
      "<br/>Don't presume to tell me\n",
      "what I will and will not do.\n",
      "<br/>You don't know me.\n",
      "<br/>Well, you would have done it already.\n",
      "<br/>You're distracting me.\n",
      "Go away.\n",
      "<br/>I can't.\n",
      "<br/>I'm involved now.\n",
      "<br/>You let go, and I'm going to have\n",
      "to jump in there after you.\n",
      "<br/>Don't be absurd.\n",
      "<br/>- You'll be killed.\n",
      "- I'm a good swimmer.\n",
      "<br/>The fall alone will kill you.\n",
      "<br/>It would hurt. I'm not\n",
      "saying it wouldn't.\n",
      "<br/>Tell you the truth...\n",
      "<br/>...I'm a lot more concerned\n",
      "about that water being so cold.\n",
      "<br/>How cold?\n",
      "<br/>Freezing.\n",
      "Maybe a couple degrees over.\n",
      "<br/>You ever, uh...\n",
      "<br/>...ever been\n",
      "to Wisconsin?\n",
      "<br/>Wh at?\n",
      "<br/>Well, they have some of\n",
      "the coldest winters around.\n",
      "<br/>I grew up there,\n",
      "near Chippewa Falls.\n",
      "<br/>I remember when I was a kid,\n",
      "me and my father, we went ice fishing...\n",
      "<br/>...out on Lake Wissota.\n",
      "<br/>Ice fishing is, you know, where you--\n",
      "<br/>I know what ice fishing is!\n",
      "<br/>Sorry.\n",
      "<br/>You just seem like, you know,\n",
      "kind of an indoor girl.\n",
      "<br/>Anyway, I...\n",
      "<br/>...fell through some thin ice.\n",
      "<br/>And I'm telling you...\n",
      "<br/>...water that cold,\n",
      "<br/>like right down there...\n",
      "<br/>...it hits you like 1000 knives\n",
      "stabbing you all over your body.\n",
      "<br/>You can't breathe.\n",
      "<br/>You can't think. Least not about\n",
      "anything but the pain.\n",
      "<br/>Which is why I'm not looking\n",
      "forward to jumping in there after you.\n",
      "<br/>Like I said...\n",
      "<br/>...I don't have a choice.\n",
      "<br/>I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll\n",
      "come back over the rail and...\n",
      "<br/>...and get me off\n",
      "the hook here.\n",
      "<br/>You're crazy.\n",
      "<br/>That's what everybody says but...\n",
      "<br/>...with all due respect, miss...\n",
      "<br/>...I'm not the one hanging off\n",
      "the back of a ship here.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, give me your hand.\n",
      "<br/>You don't want to do this.\n",
      "<br/>I'm Jack Dawson.\n",
      "<br/>Rose DeWitt Bu kater.\n",
      "<br/>I'll have to get you to\n",
      "write that one down.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>I got you.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>Help, please!\n",
      "<br/>Help!\n",
      "<br/>- Please, help me!\n",
      "- Listen. Listen to me.\n",
      "<br/>Listen. Listen to me.\n",
      "<br/>I've got you.\n",
      "I won't let go.\n",
      "<br/>Now pull yourself up.\n",
      "Come on!\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>That's right.\n",
      "<br/>You can do it.\n",
      "<br/>I got you.\n",
      "<br/>What's all this?\n",
      "<br/>You stand back and...\n",
      "<br/>...don't move an inch!\n",
      "<br/>Fetch the Master at Arms.\n",
      "<br/>This is completely unacceptable!\n",
      "<br/>What made you think that you could\n",
      "put your hands on my fiancée?!\n",
      "<br/>Look at me, you filth!\n",
      "<br/>Cal.\n",
      "<br/>What do you think\n",
      "you were doing?\n",
      "<br/>Cal, stop.\n",
      "It was an accident.\n",
      "<br/>An accident?\n",
      "<br/>It was.\n",
      "<br/>Stupid, really.\n",
      "<br/>I was leaning over and I slipped.\n",
      "<br/>I was leaning far over\n",
      "to see the, uh...\n",
      "<br/>...uh, uh, the uh...\n",
      "<br/>- Propellers?\n",
      "- Propellers, and I slipped.\n",
      "<br/>And I would have gone\n",
      "overboard but Mr. Dawson here...\n",
      "<br/>...saved me. And almost\n",
      "went over himself.\n",
      "<br/>You wanted to see the...\n",
      "She wanted to see the propellers.\n",
      "<br/>Like I said, women and\n",
      "machinery do not mix.\n",
      "<br/>Was that the way of it?\n",
      "<br/>Yeah. Yeah, that\n",
      "was pretty much it.\n",
      "<br/>Well, the boy's a hero then.\n",
      "<br/>Good for you, son.\n",
      "Well done.\n",
      "<br/>So, it's all's well and back\n",
      "to our brandy, eh?\n",
      "<br/>Look at you. You must be freezing.\n",
      "Let's get you inside.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps a little something\n",
      "for the boy?\n",
      "<br/>Of course.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Lovejoy,\n",
      "I think a 20 should do it.\n",
      "<br/>Is that the going rate\n",
      "for saving the woman you love?\n",
      "<br/>Rose is displeased.\n",
      "<br/>What to do?\n",
      "<br/>I know.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps you could join us for\n",
      "dinner tomorrow evening...\n",
      "<br/>...to regale our group...\n",
      "<br/>...with your heroic tale.\n",
      "<br/>Sure.\n",
      "Count me in.\n",
      "<br/>Good.\n",
      "It's settled then.\n",
      "<br/>This should be interesting.\n",
      "<br/>Can I bum a smoke?\n",
      "<br/>You'll want to tie those.\n",
      "<br/>It's interesting...\n",
      "<br/>...the young lady slipped\n",
      "so suddenly...\n",
      "<br/>...and you still had time to remove\n",
      "your jacket and your shoes.\n",
      "<br/>I know you've been melancholy.\n",
      "<br/>I don't pretend to know why.\n",
      "<br/>I intended to save this...\n",
      "<br/>...until the engagement\n",
      "gala next week...\n",
      "<br/>...but, I thought...\n",
      "<br/>...tonight.\n",
      "<br/>Good gracious.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps as a reminder\n",
      "of my feelings for you.\n",
      "<br/>- Is it a--\n",
      "- Diamond. Yes.\n",
      "<br/>56 carats to be exact.\n",
      "<br/>It was worn by Louis XVI.\n",
      "<br/>And they called\n",
      "it Le Coeur de Ia Mer.\n",
      "<br/>- The Heart of the Ocean.\n",
      "- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.\n",
      "<br/>It's overwhelming.\n",
      "<br/>Well, it's for royalty.\n",
      "<br/>We are royalty, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>You know, there's\n",
      "nothing I couldn't give you.\n",
      "<br/>There's nothing I'd deny you...\n",
      "<br/>...if you would not deny me.\n",
      "<br/>Open your heart to me, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I've been on my own since\n",
      "I was 15, since my folks died.\n",
      "<br/>And I had no brothers or sisters or\n",
      "close kin in that part of the country...\n",
      "<br/>...so I lit on out of there and I\n",
      "haven't been back since.\n",
      "<br/>You could just call me a\n",
      "tumbleweed blowing in the wind.\n",
      "<br/>Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile\n",
      "around this boat deck and...\n",
      "<br/>...chewed over how great the weather's\n",
      "been and how I grew up...\n",
      "<br/>...but I reckon that's not why\n",
      "you came to talk to me, is it?\n",
      "<br/>- Mr. Dawson, I--\n",
      "- Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Jack.\n",
      "<br/>I want to thank you\n",
      "for what you did.\n",
      "<br/>Not just for pulling me back,\n",
      "but for your discretion.\n",
      "<br/>You're welcome.\n",
      "<br/>Look.\n",
      "<br/>I know what you\n",
      "must be thinking.\n",
      "<br/>Poor little rich girl.\n",
      "<br/>What does she know about misery?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>No, that's not what I was thinking.\n",
      "<br/>What I was thinking was...\n",
      "<br/>---what could have happened to this girl\n",
      "to make her think she had no way out?\n",
      "<br/>Well I...\n",
      "<br/>It was everything.\n",
      "It was my whole world and...\n",
      "<br/>...all the people in it.\n",
      "<br/>And the inertia of my life,\n",
      "plunging ahead and me...\n",
      "<br/>...powerless to stop it.\n",
      "<br/>God,\n",
      "look at that thing.\n",
      "<br/>You would have gone\n",
      "straight to the bottom.\n",
      "<br/>500 invitations have gone out.\n",
      "<br/>All of Philadelphia society will be there.\n",
      "<br/>And all the while I feel I'm...\n",
      "<br/>...standing in the middle\n",
      "of a crowded room...\n",
      "<br/>...screaming at the\n",
      "top of my lungs...\n",
      "<br/>...and no one\n",
      "even looks up.\n",
      "<br/>Do you love him?\n",
      "<br/>Pardon me?\n",
      "<br/>Do you love him?\n",
      "<br/>You're being very rude. You\n",
      "shouldn't be asking me this.\n",
      "<br/>Well, it's a simple question.\n",
      "Do you love the guy or not?\n",
      "<br/>This is not a suitable conversation.\n",
      "<br/>VVhy can't you just\n",
      "answer the question?\n",
      "<br/>This is absurd.\n",
      "<br/>You don't know me\n",
      "and I don't know you...\n",
      "<br/>...and we are not having this\n",
      "conversation at all. You are rude...\n",
      "<br/>...and uncouth and presumptuous\n",
      "and I am leaving now...\n",
      "<br/>...Jack. Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "It's been a pleasure.\n",
      "<br/>I sought you out to thank you\n",
      "and now I have thanked you.\n",
      "<br/>And you've insulted me.\n",
      "<br/>Well, you deserved it.\n",
      "<br/>- Right.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "<br/>I thought you were leaving.\n",
      "<br/>I am.\n",
      "<br/>You are so annoying.\n",
      "<br/>Wait.\n",
      "<br/>I don't have to leave. This is\n",
      "my part of the ship. You leave.\n",
      "<br/>Well, well, well.\n",
      "Now who's being rude?\n",
      "<br/>What is this stupid thing\n",
      "you're carrying around?\n",
      "<br/>So, what are you,\n",
      "an artist or something?\n",
      "<br/>These are rather good.\n",
      "<br/>They're very good, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, this is exquisite work.\n",
      "<br/>Ah, they didn't think too\n",
      "much of them in old Paree.\n",
      "<br/>Paris?\n",
      "<br/>You do get around\n",
      "for a p--\n",
      "<br/>Well, a-- a\n",
      "person of limited means.\n",
      "<br/>Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.\n",
      "<br/>Well, well, well.\n",
      "<br/>And these were drawn from life?\n",
      "<br/>Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.\n",
      "<br/>Lots of girls are willing\n",
      "to take their clothes off.\n",
      "<br/>You liked this woman.\n",
      "<br/>You used her several times.\n",
      "<br/>Well.\n",
      "<br/>She had beautiful\n",
      "hands, you see?\n",
      "<br/>I think you must have\n",
      "had a love affair with her.\n",
      "<br/>No, no, no.\n",
      "Just with her hands.\n",
      "<br/>She was a\n",
      "one-legged prostitute.\n",
      "<br/>See?\n",
      "<br/>She had a good\n",
      "sense of humor though.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, and this lady...\n",
      "<br/>She used to sit at this bar every night...\n",
      "<br/>...wearing every piece\n",
      "of jewelry she owned...\n",
      "<br/>...just waiting for\n",
      "her long, lost love.\n",
      "<br/>We called her Madame Bijoux.\n",
      "<br/>See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.\n",
      "<br/>Well,\n",
      "you have a gift, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>You do.\n",
      "<br/>You see people.\n",
      "<br/>I see you.\n",
      "<br/>And?\n",
      "<br/>You wouldn't have jumped.\n",
      "<br/>But the purpose of university\n",
      "is to find a suitable husband.\n",
      "<br/>Rose has already done that.\n",
      "<br/>Look, here comes that\n",
      "vulgar Brown woman.\n",
      "<br/>Quickly, get up before\n",
      "she sits with us.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, girls. I was hoping\n",
      "I'd catch you at tea.\n",
      "<br/>We're awfully sorry,\n",
      "you missed it.\n",
      "<br/>The Countess and I were just\n",
      "off to take the air on the boat deck.\n",
      "<br/>What a lovely idea.\n",
      "I need to catch up on my gossip.\n",
      "<br/>Countess.\n",
      "<br/>So, you've not yet lit the\n",
      "last four boilers?\n",
      "<br/>No, I don't see\n",
      "the need.\n",
      "<br/>We are making excellent time.\n",
      "<br/>The press knows the size of Titanic.\n",
      "Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.\n",
      "<br/>We must give them\n",
      "something new to print.\n",
      "<br/>This maiden voyage\n",
      "of Titanic must...\n",
      "<br/>...make headlines.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. lsmay, I would prefer\n",
      "not to push the engines...\n",
      "<br/>...until they've been properly run in.\n",
      "<br/>Of course I'm just a passenger.\n",
      "<br/>I leave it to your good offices\n",
      "to decide what's best.\n",
      "<br/>But what a glorious end to your final crossing...\n",
      "<br/>...if we were to get into New York\n",
      "on Tuesday night...\n",
      "<br/>...and surprise them all.\n",
      "Make the morning papers.\n",
      "<br/>Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?\n",
      "<br/>Good man.\n",
      "<br/>After that, I worked\n",
      "on a squid boat in Monterey...\n",
      "<br/>...then I went to Los Angeles to the...\n",
      "<br/>...Santa Monica pier\n",
      "and did portraits for 10 cents each.\n",
      "<br/>Why can't I be like you?\n",
      "<br/>Just head out for the horizon\n",
      "whenever I feel like it.\n",
      "<br/>Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...\n",
      "<br/>only if we just talk about it\n",
      "<br/>No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.\n",
      "<br/>Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up\n",
      "<br/>We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.\n",
      "<br/>But you have to do it like a real cowboy.\n",
      "No sidesaddle stuff.\n",
      "<br/>You mean with one leg on each side?\n",
      "<br/>Can you show me?\n",
      "<br/>Sure, if you like.\n",
      "<br/>Teach me to ride like a man.\n",
      "<br/>Chew tobacco like a man.\n",
      "<br/>And spit like a man.\n",
      "<br/>You didn't learn in finishing school?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, I'll show you.\n",
      "<br/>I'll show you how.\n",
      "<br/>Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.\n",
      "<br/>I couldn't possibly, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Watch closely.\n",
      "<br/>That's disgusting.\n",
      "<br/>Your turn\n",
      "<br/>That was pitiful.\n",
      "You really have to hawk it back.\n",
      "<br/>Get some leverage.\n",
      "Use your arms. Arc your neck.\n",
      "<br/>You see the range on that thing?\n",
      "<br/>Okay, go.\n",
      "<br/>That was better. You have to work on it.\n",
      "Really try to hawk it up.\n",
      "<br/>Mother.\n",
      "<br/>May I introduce Jack Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>Charmed, I'm sure.\n",
      "<br/>The others were gracious and curious\n",
      "about the man who'd saved my life.\n",
      "<br/>But my mother looked at him like an insect.\n",
      "<br/>A dangerous insect\n",
      "which must be squashed quickly.\n",
      "<br/>Sounds like you're a good man\n",
      "to have around in a sticky spot.\n",
      "<br/>Why do they always insist on announcing\n",
      "dinner like a damn cavalry charge?\n",
      "<br/>Shall we go dress, Mother?\n",
      "<br/>See you at dinner, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Uh, son?\n",
      "<br/>Son!\n",
      "<br/>Do you have any idea what you're doing?\n",
      "<br/>Not really.\n",
      "<br/>You're about to go into the snake pit.\n",
      "<br/>What are you going to wear?\n",
      "<br/>I figured. Come on.\n",
      "<br/>I was right. You and my son\n",
      "are just about the same size.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty close.\n",
      "<br/>You shine up like a new penny.\n",
      "<br/>Good evening, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Thousands of tons of Hockley steel\n",
      "are in this ship.\n",
      "<br/>- Which part?\n",
      "- All the right ones.\n",
      "<br/>Then you're accountable\n",
      "if there's a problem. Where's Rose?\n",
      "<br/>She'll be along.\n",
      "<br/>There is the Countess.\n",
      "<br/>I saw that in a nickelodeon\n",
      "and always wanted to do it.\n",
      "<br/>Darling...\n",
      "<br/>...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "<br/>It's amazing.\n",
      "You could almost pass for a gentleman.\n",
      "<br/>Almost.\n",
      "<br/>This is extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>This is a remarkable voyage.\n",
      "<br/>- Mad.\n",
      "- Completely lunatic.\n",
      "<br/>There's the Countess of Rothes.\n",
      "<br/>That's John Jacob Astor...\n",
      "<br/>...the richest man on board.\n",
      "<br/>His little wifey, Madeleine,\n",
      "is my age and in a delicate condition.\n",
      "<br/>See how she tries to hide it.\n",
      "<br/>Quite the scandal.\n",
      "<br/>Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,\n",
      "Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...\n",
      "<br/>...is at home with the children, of course.\n",
      "And over here...\n",
      "<br/>...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.\n",
      "<br/>She designs naughty lingerie,\n",
      "among her many talents.\n",
      "<br/>Very popular with the royals.\n",
      "<br/>Congratulations. She's splendid.\n",
      "<br/>Why, thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Escort a lady to dinner?\n",
      "<br/>Certainly.\n",
      "<br/>Sweet pea, sweet pea.\n",
      "<br/>Ain't nothing to it.\n",
      "<br/>They love money. Pretend like you own\n",
      "a gold mine and you're in the club.\n",
      "<br/>Hey, Astor.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.\n",
      "<br/>J.J., Madeleine,\n",
      "I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.\n",
      "<br/>Well, Jack...\n",
      "<br/>...are you of the Boston Dawsons?\n",
      "<br/>No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br/>He must have been nervous,\n",
      "but he never faltered.\n",
      "<br/>They assumed he was one of them.\n",
      "<br/>Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.\n",
      "<br/>New money, obviously,\n",
      "but still a member of the club.\n",
      "<br/>Mother, of course,\n",
      "could always be counted upon.\n",
      "<br/>Tell us of the accommodations in steerage\n",
      "Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good-\n",
      "<br/>The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.\n",
      "<br/>He was of help to my fiancée last night.\n",
      "<br/>It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.\n",
      "<br/>He showed me some of his work today.\n",
      "<br/>Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.\n",
      "Not to impugn your work, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Are all these mine?\n",
      "<br/>Start from the outside and work in.\n",
      "<br/>He knows every rivet in her.\n",
      "<br/>Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>How do you take your caviar, sir?\n",
      "<br/>No caviar for me, thanks.\n",
      "Never did like it much.\n",
      "<br/>Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>After that, I'm on God's good humor.\n",
      "<br/>How do you have means to travel?\n",
      "<br/>I work my way from place to place.\n",
      "Tramp steamers and such.\n",
      "<br/>I won my ticket on Titanic\n",
      "at a lucky hand at poker.\n",
      "<br/>A very lucky hand.\n",
      "<br/>All life is a game of luck.\n",
      "<br/>A real man makes his own luck.\n",
      "Right, Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>And you find\n",
      "that sort of rootless existence appealing?\n",
      "<br/>Yes, ma'am, I do.\n",
      "<br/>I've got everything I need\n",
      "right here with me.\n",
      "<br/>I have air in my lungs\n",
      "and blank sheets of paper.\n",
      "<br/>I love waking up, not knowing\n",
      "what will happen or who I'll meet.\n",
      "<br/>Where I'll wind up.\n",
      "<br/>One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...\n",
      "<br/>...now I'm on the grandest ship\n",
      "in the world, with you fine people.\n",
      "<br/>I'll take more of that.\n",
      "<br/>Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.\n",
      "<br/>You never know what hand you'll get dealt.\n",
      "<br/>You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.\n",
      "<br/>Make each day count.\n",
      "<br/>Well said, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Hear, hear.\n",
      "<br/>To making it count.\n",
      "<br/>To making it count.\n",
      "<br/>Bravo.\n",
      "<br/>But Mr. Brown didn't know\n",
      "I'd hidden the money in the stove.\n",
      "<br/>He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating\n",
      "and lights a fire.\n",
      "<br/>Next is brandy in the smoking room.\n",
      "<br/>Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?\n",
      "<br/>Now they retreat to congratulate each\n",
      "other on being masters of the universe.\n",
      "<br/>Ladies, thank you for your company.\n",
      "<br/>May I escort you to the cabin?\n",
      "<br/>No, I'll stay here.\n",
      "<br/>Here, Molly.\n",
      "<br/>Joining us, Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>You don't want to stay with the women.\n",
      "<br/>No, thanks. I have to head back.\n",
      "<br/>That's best. It'll be all business and politics.\n",
      "Wouldn't interest you.\n",
      "<br/>But Dawson, good of you to come.\n",
      "<br/>Must you go?\n",
      "<br/>Time for me to row with the other slaves.\n",
      "<br/>Good night, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Want to go to a real party?\n",
      "<br/>Is okay I put my hand here?\n",
      "<br/>I can't understand you.\n",
      "<br/>I'm going to dance with her now.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>Come on. Come with me.\n",
      "<br/>Jack. Jack, wait.\n",
      "<br/>I can't do this.\n",
      "<br/>We'll have to get a bit closer.\n",
      "<br/>Like this.\n",
      "<br/>You're still my best girl, Cora.\n",
      "<br/>- I don't know the steps.\n",
      "- Me, either. Just go with it.\n",
      "<br/>Don't think.\n",
      "<br/>Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!\n",
      "<br/>Wh at? Wait!\n",
      "<br/>Jack, no.\n",
      "<br/>--Beyond the jurisdiction\n",
      "of the Sherman Act.\n",
      "<br/>That's what Rockefeller said--\n",
      "Supreme Court didn't swallow it.\n",
      "<br/>What? You think\n",
      "a first-class girl can't drink?\n",
      "<br/>Get out of here.\n",
      "<br/>Are you all right?\n",
      "<br/>I'm fine.\n",
      "<br/>Two out of three.\n",
      "<br/>So...\n",
      "<br/>...you think you're tough?\n",
      "<br/>Let's see you do this.\n",
      "<br/>Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.\n",
      "<br/>Jesus!\n",
      "<br/>You okay?\n",
      "<br/>I haven't done that in years.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go.\n",
      "<br/>Coffee, sir?\n",
      "<br/>You didn't come to me last night.\n",
      "<br/>I was tired.\n",
      "<br/>Your exertions below deck\n",
      "were no doubt exhausting.\n",
      "<br/>I see you had\n",
      "that undertaker of a manservant follow me.\n",
      "<br/>You will never behave like that again.\n",
      "<br/>I'm not one of your mill foremen\n",
      "who you can command.\n",
      "<br/>I'm your fiancée.\n",
      "<br/>My fiancée. My fiancée!\n",
      "<br/>Yes, you are! And my wife!\n",
      "<br/>My wife in practice,\n",
      "if not yet by law, so you will honor me!\n",
      "<br/>You will honor me the way\n",
      "a wife honors her husband.\n",
      "<br/>Because I will not be made a fool of.\n",
      "<br/>Is this in any way unclear?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Good. Excuse me.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, Miss Rose.\n",
      "<br/>We had a little accident.\n",
      "<br/>- That's all right.\n",
      "- I'm sorry.\n",
      "<br/>Let me help you.\n",
      "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br/>Tea, Trudy.\n",
      "<br/>You're not to see that boy again.\n",
      "You understand?\n",
      "<br/>Rose, I forbid it.\n",
      "<br/>Stop it, Mother.\n",
      "You'll give yourself a nosebleed.\n",
      "<br/>This is not a game.\n",
      "<br/>Our situation is precarious.\n",
      "You know the money's gone.\n",
      "<br/>Of course I know.\n",
      "You remind me every day.\n",
      "<br/>Your father left us nothing but a legacy\n",
      "of bad debts hidden by a good name.\n",
      "<br/>That name is the only card we have to play.\n",
      "<br/>I don't understand you.\n",
      "<br/>It is a fine match with Hockley.\n",
      "It will ensure our survival.\n",
      "<br/>How can you put this on me?\n",
      "<br/>Why are you being so selfish?\n",
      "<br/>I'm being selfish?\n",
      "<br/>Do you want to see me\n",
      "working as a seamstress?\n",
      "<br/>Is that what you want?\n",
      "<br/>To see our fine things sold at auction?\n",
      "<br/>Our memories scattered?\n",
      "<br/>It's so unfair.\n",
      "<br/>Of course it's unfair.\n",
      "<br/>We're women.\n",
      "<br/>Our choices are never easy.\n",
      "<br/>Protect them by Thy guiding hand\n",
      "<br/>From every peril on the land\n",
      "<br/>O, spirit whom the Father sent\n",
      "<br/>To spread abroad the firmament\n",
      "<br/>O, wind of heaven, by Thy might\n",
      "<br/>Save all who dare the eagle 's ﬂight\n",
      "<br/>And keep them by Thy watchful care...\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>I need to talk to someone.\n",
      "<br/>You're not supposed to be in here.\n",
      "<br/>I was here last night, remember?\n",
      "<br/>No. Now please turn around.\n",
      "<br/>He'll tell you. I just need to talk--\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...\n",
      "<br/>...are still appreciative of your assistance.\n",
      "<br/>They asked me\n",
      "to give you this in gratitude--\n",
      "<br/>I don't want your money.\n",
      "<br/>--And remind you you are\n",
      "in third class and your presence here...\n",
      "<br/>...is no longer appropriate.\n",
      "<br/>Let me speak to Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson\n",
      "returns to where he belongs...\n",
      "<br/>...and that he stays there?\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Come along, you.\n",
      "<br/>Hear us when we cry to Thee\n",
      "<br/>For those in peril on the sea\n",
      "<br/>Why are there two steering wheels?\n",
      "<br/>We use this one near shore.\n",
      "<br/>Excuse me, sir.\n",
      "Another ice warning, from the Noordam.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Sparks.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry.\n",
      "Quite normal for this time of year.\n",
      "<br/>In fact, we're speeding up.\n",
      "I've ordered the last boilers lit.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, son, wind it up tight\n",
      "like I showed you. That's right.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, now let it go.\n",
      "<br/>- It was good, wasn't it?\n",
      "- Quite nice. That's excellent.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Andrews...Forgive me.\n",
      "<br/>I did the sum\n",
      "in my head...\n",
      "<br/>...and with the number of lifeboats\n",
      "times the capacity you mentioned...\n",
      "<br/>Forgive me, but it seems that there are\n",
      "not enough for everyone aboard.\n",
      "<br/>About half, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Rose, you miss nothing,\n",
      "do you?\n",
      "<br/>In fact, I put in these new\n",
      "type davits...\n",
      "<br/>...which can take an extra row\n",
      "of boats inside this one.\n",
      "<br/>But it was thought,\n",
      "by some...\n",
      "<br/>...the deck would look\n",
      "too cluttered.\n",
      "<br/>So, I was overruled.\n",
      "<br/>It's a waste of deck space\n",
      "as it is on an unsinkable ship.\n",
      "<br/>Sleep soundly, young Rose.\n",
      "<br/>I have built you a good ship,\n",
      "strong and true.\n",
      "<br/>She's all the lifeboat\n",
      "you need.\n",
      "<br/>Just keep heading aft. The next\n",
      "stop will be the engine room.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, this is impossible.\n",
      "I can't see you.\n",
      "<br/>- I need to talk to you.\n",
      "- No, Jack. No.\n",
      "<br/>Jack.\n",
      "I'm engaged.\n",
      "<br/>I'm marrying Cal.\n",
      "<br/>I love Cal.\n",
      "<br/>Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...you're no picnic. All right?\n",
      "You're a spoiled little brat even.\n",
      "<br/>But under that, you're the\n",
      "most amazingly, astounding\n",
      "<br/>...wonderful girl...\n",
      "<br/>...woman, that I've ever known.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, I--\n",
      "<br/>No, let me try and get\n",
      "this out. You're ama--\n",
      "<br/>I'm not an idiot.\n",
      "I know how the world works.\n",
      "<br/>I've got ten bucks\n",
      "in my pocket.\n",
      "<br/>I have nothing to offer\n",
      "you and I know that.\n",
      "<br/>I understand.\n",
      "<br/>But I'm too involved now.\n",
      "<br/>You jump, I jump\n",
      "Remember?\n",
      "<br/>I can't turn away without\n",
      "knowing you'll be all right.\n",
      "<br/>That's all that I want.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I'm fine.\n",
      "<br/>I'll be fine. Really.\n",
      "<br/>Really?\n",
      "<br/>I don't think so.\n",
      "<br/>They've got you trapped, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>And you're gonna die if you\n",
      "don't break free.\n",
      "<br/>Maybe not right away...\n",
      "<br/>...because you're strong...\n",
      "<br/>...but sooner or later that\n",
      "fire that I love about you, Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...that fire is gonna\n",
      "burn out.\n",
      "<br/>It's not up to you\n",
      "to save me, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>You're right.\n",
      "<br/>Only you can do that.\n",
      "<br/>I'm going back.\n",
      "<br/>Leave me alone.\n",
      "<br/>Tell Lucile about the disaster\n",
      "you had with the stationers.\n",
      "<br/>Well, of course the invitations\n",
      "had to be sent back, twice.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, my dear.\n",
      "<br/>And the dreadful\n",
      "bridesmaids' gowns.\n",
      "<br/>Let me tell you what an\n",
      "odyssey that has been.\n",
      "<br/>Rose decided she\n",
      "wanted lavender.\n",
      "<br/>She knows I detest the color.\n",
      "<br/>So, she did it only to spite me.\n",
      "<br/>If only you'd come to\n",
      "me sooner.\n",
      "<br/>Ruth saw some of my designs in\n",
      "La Mode Illustrée.\n",
      "<br/>They were for the trousseau of the Duchess\n",
      "of Marlborough's youngest daughter.\n",
      "<br/>They were quite charming.\n",
      "<br/>But, I think you'll agree,\n",
      "my dear, that together...\n",
      "<br/>...we've created something\n",
      "of a phoenix from the ashes.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>I changed my mind.\n",
      "<br/>They said you might be up here.\n",
      "<br/>Give me your hand.\n",
      "<br/>Now close your eyes.\n",
      "<br/>Go on.\n",
      "<br/>Now, step up.\n",
      "<br/>Now, hold onto the railing.\n",
      "<br/>Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "Don't peek.\n",
      "<br/>I'm not.\n",
      "<br/>Now, step up onto the rail.\n",
      "<br/>Hold on. Hold on.\n",
      "<br/>Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "<br/>Do you trust me?\n",
      "<br/>I trust you.\n",
      "<br/>All right...\n",
      "<br/>---Open your eyes.\n",
      "<br/>I'm flying.\n",
      "<br/>Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Come, Josephine, in my\n",
      "ﬂying machine. Going up...\n",
      "<br/>...she goes. Up she goes.\n",
      "<br/>That was the last time\n",
      "Titanic ever saw daylight.\n",
      "<br/>We're up to dusk the\n",
      "night of the sinking.\n",
      "<br/>6 hours to go.\n",
      "<br/>Incredible. There's Smith and\n",
      "he's standing there and...\n",
      "<br/>...he's got the iceberg warning\n",
      "in his fucking hand...\n",
      "<br/>...excuse me--his hand,\n",
      "and he's ordering more speed.\n",
      "<br/>26 years of experience\n",
      "working against him.\n",
      "<br/>He figures anything big\n",
      "enough to sink, the ship...\n",
      "<br/>...they're gonna see in time to turn.\n",
      "<br/>But the ship's too big\n",
      "with too small a rudder.\n",
      "<br/>Doesn't corner worth a damn.\n",
      "<br/>Everything he knows\n",
      "is wrong.\n",
      "<br/>It's quite proper, I assure you.\n",
      "This is the sitting room.\n",
      "<br/>- Will this light do?\n",
      "- What?\n",
      "<br/>Don't artists need good light?\n",
      "<br/>That is true, but I'm not\n",
      "used to working in...\n",
      "<br/>...such horrible conditions.\n",
      "<br/>Monet!\n",
      "<br/>- Do you know his work?\n",
      "- Of course.\n",
      "<br/>Look at his use of color here.\n",
      "Isn't he great?\n",
      "<br/>I know. It's extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>Cal insists on carting\n",
      "this hideous thing everywhere.\n",
      "<br/>Should we be expecting him\n",
      "any time soon?\n",
      "<br/>Not as long as the cigars\n",
      "and brandy hold out.\n",
      "<br/>That's nice.\n",
      "<br/>What is it,\n",
      "a sapphire?\n",
      "<br/>A diamond.\n",
      "<br/>A very rare diamond.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, I want you to draw me\n",
      "like one of your French girls.\n",
      "<br/>Wearing this.\n",
      "<br/>All right.\n",
      "<br/>Wearing only this.\n",
      "<br/>The last thing I need is another picture of me\n",
      "looking like a porcelain doll.\n",
      "<br/>As a paying customer...\n",
      "<br/>...I expect to get\n",
      "what I want.\n",
      "<br/>Over on the bed\n",
      "...uh, the couch.\n",
      "<br/>Come. Lie down.\n",
      "<br/>- Tell me when it looks right.\n",
      "- Keep that.\n",
      "<br/>Put your arm back\n",
      "the way it was.\n",
      "<br/>Put that other arm up,\n",
      "that hand right by your face there.\n",
      "<br/>Right.\n",
      "<br/>Now, head down.\n",
      "<br/>Eyes to me.\n",
      "Keep them on me.\n",
      "<br/>And try to stay still.\n",
      "<br/>So serious.\n",
      "<br/>I believe you are blushing,\n",
      "Mr. Big Artiste.\n",
      "<br/>I can't imagine\n",
      "Monsieur Monet blushing.\n",
      "<br/>He does landscapes.\n",
      "<br/>- Just relax your face.\n",
      "- Sorry.\n",
      "<br/>No laughing.\n",
      "<br/>My heart was pounding\n",
      "the whole time.\n",
      "<br/>It was the most erotic\n",
      "moment of my life...\n",
      "<br/>...up until then, at least.\n",
      "<br/>So what happened next?\n",
      "<br/>You mean,\n",
      "did we do it?\n",
      "<br/>Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.\n",
      "<br/>Jack was very professional.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>What are you doing?\n",
      "<br/>Will you put this\n",
      "back in the safe for me?\n",
      "<br/>Gentlemen, would you excuse me.\n",
      "<br/>None of the stewards\n",

      "<br/>This is absurd.\n",

      "- Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I don't think I've ever\n",
      "seen such a flat calm.\n",
      "<br/>Like a mill pond.\n",
      "<br/>Not a breath of wind.\n",
      "<br/>It will make the bergs\n",
      "harder to see---\n",
      "<br/>...with no breaking\n",

      "<br/>Well, I'm off.\n",
      "<br/>Maintain speed and\n",

      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",

      "<br/>Bye.\n",
      "<br/>Sorry.\n",
      "<br/>- Keep going.\n",

      "<br/>Pretty tough for\n",

      "<br/>You shouldn't be down here.\n",

      "<br/>You nervous?\n",

      "<br/>Bollocks!\n",
      "<br/>Well, I can, all right?\n",
      "<br/>Did you ever find those\n",

      "<br/>Anything missing?\n",
      "<br/>I have a better idea.\n",
      "<br/>GOI you!\n",
      "<br/>Did you see those guys' faces?\n",
      "<br/>Did you see them?\n",
      "<br/>When the ship docks...\n",
      "<br/>...I'm getting off with you.\n",
      "<br/>This is crazy.\n",
      "<br/>I know. It doesn't make any sense.\n",
      "<br/>That's why I trust it.\n",
      "<br/>Here, look at this.\n",
      "<br/>Look at that, would you?\n",
      "<br/>They're warmer than we are.\n",
      "<br/>If that's what it takes for us to get warm,\n",
      "I'd rather not.\n",
      "<br/>Bugger me!\n",
      "<br/>Pick up, you bastards!\n",
      "<br/>Is anyone there?!\n",
      "<br/>What do you see?\n",
      "<br/>Iceberg, right ahead!\n",
      "<br/>Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Iceberg ahead!\n",
      "<br/>Hard a' starboard!\n",
      "<br/>Turn! Turn! Srnartly!\n",
      "<br/>Full astern!\n",
      "<br/>Hard over.\n",
      "<br/>Helm's hard over, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Go, lads, go!\n",
      "<br/>Bring that steam down! Bring it down!\n",
      "<br/>Shut all the dampers! Shut them!\n",
      "<br/>Hold it.\n",
      "<br/>Hold it!\n",
      "<br/>Now! Engage reversing engine!\n",
      "<br/>Why ain't they turning?\n",
      "<br/>Is it hard over?!\n",
      "<br/>It is, sir. Hard over.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, come on, come on. Turn.\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>It's going to hit!\n",
      "<br/>Jesus Christ!\n",
      "<br/>Jesus!\n",
      "<br/>Hard to port!\n",
      "<br/>Hard to port!\n",
      "<br/>Get back!\n",
      "<br/>Let's go!\n",
      "<br/>They're closing the doors! Get out!\n",
      "<br/>Get out the door! Go!\n",
      "<br/>Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!\n",
      "<br/>Go! Go!\n",
      "<br/>Out! Out!\n",
      "<br/>Oh, my God.\n",
      "<br/>That was a close shave.\n",
      "<br/>Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!\n",
      "<br/>Note the time. Enter it in the log.\n",
      "<br/>What was that, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br/>An iceberg, sir.\n",
      "<br/>I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close.\n",
      "<br/>I tried to port round it, but--\n",
      "<br/>- Close the watertight doors.\n",
      "- They're closed, sir.\n",
      "<br/>All stop.\n",
      "<br/>Have the carpenter sound the ship.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, let's get the hell out of here!\n",
      "<br/>Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.\n",
      "<br/>That's the shudder you felt.\n",
      "Do you need anything?\n",
      "<br/>No, thank you.\n",
      "<br/>There's talk of an iceberg.\n",
      "<br/>I don't see anything. Do you?\n",
      "<br/>If this is where the rats are going, I am, too.\n",
      "<br/>- You.\n",
      "- There is no emergency.\n",
      "<br/>- There is. I've been robbed.\n",
      "- Get the Master at Arms.\n",
      "<br/>Now, you moron!\n",
      "<br/>Did I miss the fun?\n",
      "<br/>- Did you see what happened?\n",
      "- No- I guess it hit over there-\n",
      "<br/>Boiler room six is flooded eight feet\n",
      "and the mail hold is worse.\n",
      "<br/>- Can you shore up?\n",
      "- Not unless the pumps get ahead.\n",
      "<br/>- Have you seen the mail hold?\n",
      "- It's already underwater.\n",
      "<br/>This is bad.\n",
      "<br/>We should tell Mother and Cal.\n",
      "<br/>I think they're very good, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Don't touch anything.\n",
      "I want the room photographed.\n",
      "<br/>We've been looking for you, miss.\n",
      "<br/>Here we go.\n",
      "<br/>Something serious has happened.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, it has.\n",
      "<br/>Indeed.\n",
      "Two things dear to me have disappeared.\n",
      "<br/>Now that one is back,\n",
      "I know where to find the other. Search him.\n",
      "<br/>- Take your coat off.\n",
      "- Now what?\n",
      "<br/>What are you doing?\n",
      "We're in the middle of an emergency.\n",
      "<br/>- Is this it?\n",
      "- That's it.\n",
      "<br/>This is horseshit!\n",
      "<br/>Don't you believe it.\n",
      "<br/>- He couldn't have.\n",
      "- Easy enough for a professional.\n",
      "<br/>I was with him the entire time.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps he did it while you were putting\n",
      "your clothes back on, dear.\n",
      "<br/>Real slick. They put it in my pocket.\n",
      "<br/>- Shut up.\n",
      "- It isn't even your pocket.\n",
      "<br/>\"Property of A.L. Ryerson.\"\n",
      "<br/>That was reported stolen.\n",
      "<br/>I just borrowed it.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, we have an honest thief.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do this, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Don't believe them. You know it.\n",
      "<br/>Let's go, son.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do it!\n",
      "<br/>There's a good lad. Come on.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do it! You know me!\n",
      "<br/>This is most unfortunate, Captain.\n",
      "<br/>Water fourteen feet above the keel\n",
      "in ten minutes...\n",
      "<br/>...in the forepeak,\n",
      "all three holds and boiler room six.\n",
      "<br/>That's right.\n",
      "<br/>When can we get underway?\n",
      "<br/>That's five compartments.\n",
      "<br/>She can float with four compartments breached,\n",
      "but not five.\n",
      "<br/>Not five. As she goes down,\n",
      "the water will spill...\n",
      "<br/>...over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,\n",
      "one to the next...\n",
      "<br/>...back and back. There's no stopping it.\n",
      "<br/>The pumps.\n",
      "<br/>The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.\n",
      "<br/>As of now, no matter what we do...\n",
      "<br/>...Titanic will founder.\n",
      "<br/>But this ship can't sink.\n",
      "<br/>She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.\n",
      "<br/>And she will.\n",
      "<br/>It's a mathematical certainty.\n",
      "<br/>How much time?\n",
      "<br/>An hour. Two, at most.\n",
      "<br/>How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br/>Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I believe you may get your headlines,\n",
      "Mr. lsmay.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?\n",
      "<br/>Look at me when I'm talking to you!\n",
      "<br/>- Mr. Hockley?\n",
      "- Not now. We're busy.\n",
      "<br/>You've been asked to put on lifebelts\n",
      "and go to the boat deck.\n",
      "<br/>I said, not now.\n",
      "<br/>I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.\n",
      "Dress warmly.\n",
      "<br/>It's quite cold out.\n",
      "<br/>May I suggest topcoats and hats?\n",
      "<br/>This is ridiculous.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry, miss.\n",
      "I'm sure it's just a precaution.\n",
      "<br/>Everybody up! Lifebelts on!\n",
      "<br/>What's he on about?\n",
      "<br/>- Put your lifebelts on!\n",
      "- What is it?\n",
      "<br/>Just put them on.\n",
      "<br/>C.O.D.?\n",
      "<br/>Sir?\n",
      "<br/>That's right, C.O.D. The distress call.\n",
      "That's our position.\n",
      "<br/>Tell whoever responds we're going down\n",
      "and need immediate assistance.\n",
      "<br/>Blimey.\n",
      "<br/>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br/>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br/>Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!\n",
      "<br/>Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft!\n",
      "<br/>Release those ties!\n",
      "<br/>Roll back that cover! Smartly now!\n",
      "<br/>Where are the passengers?\n",
      "<br/>They went inside- Too cold and noisy for them\n",
      "<br/>You there! Get down here\n",
      "and help with these lines!\n",
      "<br/>Care for a drink, sir?\n",
      "<br/>Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed up\n",
      "and now we're cooling our heels.\n",
      "<br/>Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.\n",
      "<br/>Nobody knows what's going on.\n",
      "<br/>Just like the damn English--everything by the book.\n",
      "<br/>No need for language, Mr. Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.\n",
      "I want a cup of tea when I return.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.\n",
      "<br/>Please tell me the truth.\n",
      "<br/>The ship will sink.\n",
      "<br/>You're certain?\n",
      "<br/>In an hour or so, all this\n",
      "will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.\n",
      "<br/>Please, tell only who you must.\n",
      "I don't want to cause a panic.\n",
      "<br/>And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.\n",
      "<br/>You remember what I told you about the boats?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I understand.\n",
      "<br/>Over here, son.\n",
      "<br/>Sir, there's a big mob\n",
      "at the Second Class Purser's office.\n",
      "<br/>Go on. I'll watch him.\n",
      "<br/>Aye. Right.\n",
      "<br/>Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.\n",
      "Full steam for them, sir.\n",
      "<br/>She's the only one responding?\n",
      "<br/>The only one close. They'll be here in four hours.\n",
      "<br/>Four hours?!\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Bride.\n",
      "<br/>My God.\n",
      "<br/>We are swung out and ready, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Hadn't we better get the women and children\n",
      "into the boats?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>Women and children first, yes.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!\n",
      "<br/>Step this way, please. That's right.\n",
      "<br/>Come towards me. Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Good.\n",
      "<br/>For the time being,\n",
      "I require only women and children\n",
      "<br/>Right here.\n",
      "<br/>Like the Captain said,\n",
      "nice and cheery, so there's no panic.\n",
      "<br/>\"Wedding Dance.\"\n",
      "<br/>Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.\n",
      "<br/>Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.\n",
      "<br/>Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around.\n",
      "<br/>It isn't time to go to the boats yet!\n",
      "<br/>Please, stay calm.\n",
      "<br/>Make sure you have your lifebelts on.\n",
      "<br/>Let women and children through to the front.\n",
      "<br/>What are we doing?\n",
      "<br/>Waiting. Once first-class people\n",
      "are in the boats...\n",
      "<br/>...they'll start with us and we want to be ready.\n",
      "<br/>Pushing won't get you out any faster.\n",
      "<br/>Go get help.\n",
      "<br/>Lower it away, left and right together! Steady.\n",
      "<br/>Both sides together! Steady!\n",
      "<br/>Steady!\n",
      "<br/>Steady!\n",
      "<br/>Stop, stop, stop!\n",
      "<br/>Hold the left!\n",

      "Lower away together!\n",
      "<br/>Steady, lads!\n",
      "<br/>You know, I do believe this ship may sink.\n",
      "<br/>I've been asked to give you\n",
      "this small token of our appreciation.\n",
      "<br/>Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, sister, you heard\n",
      "the man. Into the boat.\n",
      "<br/>Any room for a gentleman,\n",
      "gentlemen?\n",
      "<br/>Only women at this time, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Will the lifeboats be\n",
      "seated according to class?\n",
      "<br/>I hope they're not too crowded.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, Mother, shut up!\n",
      "<br/>Don't you understand?\n",
      "<br/>The water is freezing and\n",
      "there aren't enough boats.\n",
      "<br/>Not enough by half.\n",
      "<br/>Half the people on this\n",
      "ship are going to die.\n",
      "<br/>Not the better half.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, Ruth,\n",
      "get in the boat.\n",
      "<br/>First class seats\n",
      "are right up here.\n",
      "<br/>You know, it's a pity I didn't\n",
      "keep that drawing.\n",
      "<br/>It'll be worth a lot\n",
      "more by morning.\n",
      "<br/>You unimaginable bastard.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, Rose darling.\n",
      "There's plenty of room for you.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>You're next, darling.\n",

      "<br/>Come.\n",
      "<br/>Rose.\n",

      "You copy? Okay, copy that. Okay, right there. Right there. Okay, that's it, that's it.\n",
      "That's the bedroom door. I see it. I see it. We're in! We're in, baby. We're there. That's Hockley's bed. That's where the\n",
      "son of a bitch slept. Oops. Somebody left the water running. Hold it. Hold it just a second.\n",
      "Go back to the right. That wardrobe door.\n",
      "Get closer. You smelling something, boss? - I want to see what's under it.\n",
      "- Give me my hands, man. All right. - Take it easy. It might come apart.\n",
      "- Okay. Go, go, go. Flip it over.\n",
      "Flip it over. Go. Turn her over. Keep going. Go, Q0, 9°- Okay, drop it. Oh, baby, baby.\n",
      "Are you seeing this, boss? It's payday, boys. Cha-ching! - We did it, Bobby.\n",
      "- We brought it back, Baby. Oh, yeah! Who's the best?\n",
      "Who's the best, baby? Say it. Say it. Say it. You are, Lewis. - Bobby, my cigar.\n",
      "- Right here. Okay, crack her open. Shit. No diamond. You know boss, this same thing happened\n",
      "to Geraldo and his career never recovered. Turn the camera off. Brock, the partners would like\n",
      "to know how it's going. Hey, Dave, Barry, hi. Look, I it wasn't\n",
      "in the safe. But hey, hey... ...Don't worry about it. There's still\n",
      "plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes. The floor debris in the suite,\n",
      "the mother's room... the purser's safe on C deck. Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase. A dozen other places. Guys, look, you're just\n",
      "going to have to trust my instincts. I know we're close. We've just got to go through a little\n",
      "process of elimination. Hang on a second. - Let me see that.\n",
      "- Ah, we may have something here, guys. Where's the photograph\n",
      "of the necklace? We'll call you right back. I'll be goddamned. Treasure hunter Brock Lovett\n",
      "is best known for finding Spanish gold... It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute. Now he has chartered Russian subs to reach\n",
      "the most famous shipwreck of all, the Titanic. He is with us live via satellite\n",
      "from the research ship Keldysh... ...in the North Atlantic. Hello, Brock. Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows\n",
      "the familiar stories of Titanic. You know, the nobility of the\n",
      "band playing to the very end and all that. But what I'm interested in are the untold stories.\n",
      "The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic. And we're out here using robot\n",
      "technology to go further into the wreck... ...than anybody has ever done before. Your expedition is at the center\n",
      "of a storm of controversy... ...over salvage rights and even ethics.\n",
      "Many are calling you a graverobber. Well, nobody ever called the\n",
      "recovery of the artifacts... What is it? Turn that up, dear. I have museum-trained experts\n",
      "sent out here making sure... ---that these relics are preserved\n",
      "and catalogued properly. Take a look at this drawing\n",
      "that we found just today. A piece of paper that's been underwater\n",
      "for 84 years. And my team are able to\n",
      "preserve it intact. Should this have remained unseen\n",
      "at the bottom of the ocean for eternity... ...when we can see and enjoy it now? I'll be goddamned. Brock! There's a satellite call for you. Bobby, we're launching. You see\n",
      "these submersibles going in the water? Trust me, buddy.\n",
      "You want to take this call. This better be good. Now, you gotta speak up.\n",
      "She's kind of old. Great. This is Brock Lovett.\n",
      "How can I help you, Mrs...? Calvert. Rose Calvert. Mrs. Calvert. I was just wondering if you had found... ...the \"Heart of the Ocean\" yet, Mr. Lovett. Told you you wanted to take the call. All right, you have my\n",
      "attention, Rose. Can you tell us who the woman\n",
      "in the picture is? Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me. She's a goddamn liar!\n",
      "Some nutcase seeking money or publicity. God only knows why.\n",
      "Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia. They're inbound! Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the\n",
      "Titanic when she was 17, right? - That's right.\n",
      "- If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now. 101 next month. Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar. Look, I've already done the\n",
      "background on this woman... ...all the way back to the 20s,\n",
      "when she was working as an actress. An actress.\n",
      "There's your first clue, Sherlock. Her name was Rose Dawson back then.\n",
      "Then she marries this guy named Calvert. They move to Cedar Rapids\n",
      "and she punches out a couple of kids. Now Calvert's dead\n",
      "and, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead. And everybody who knows about the\n",
      "diamond is supposed to be dead... ...or on this boat,\n",
      "but she knows. Doesn't exactly travel light, does she? Hurry up, give him a hand. Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.\n",
      "Welcome to the Keldysh. Okay, let's get her inside there. Hi, Miss Calvert. - Hi.\n",
      "- Welcome to the Keldysh. Thanks. Hey! Are your staterooms\n",
      "all right? Oh, yes. Very nice. Have you met my\n",
      "granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me. We met just a few\n",
      "minutes ago. Remember, Nana?\n",
      "Up on deck? Oh, yes. There. That's nice. Have to have my\n",
      "pictures when I travel. Can I get you anything? Is there anything you'd like? Yes. I would like to\n",
      "see my drawing. Louis XVI wore a fabulous\n",
      "stone that was... ...called the Blue Diamond\n",
      "of the Crown... ...which disappeared\n",
      "in 1792... ...about the same time old Louis lost\n",
      "everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the\n",
      "crown diamond was chopped, too. Recut into a heart-like shape that\n",
      "became known as... ...the Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth\n",
      "more than the Hope diamond. It was a dreadful,\n",
      "heavy thing. I only wore it this once. You actually think\n",
      "this is you, Nana? It is me, dear. Wasn't I a dish? I tracked it down\n",
      "through insurance records. An old claim that was settled\n",
      "under terms of absolute secrecy. Can you tell me who the\n",
      "claimant was, Rose? I should imagine someone\n",
      "named Hockley. Nathan Hockley,\n",
      "that's right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. The claim was for a\n",
      "diamond necklace his son... ...Caledon, bought his fiancée. You. A week before he\n",
      "sailed on Titanic. And it was filed right\n",
      "after the sinking. So the diamond had to have\n",
      "gone down with the ship. You see the date? April 14, 1912 Which means if your grandmother\n",
      "is who she says she is... ...she was wearing the diamond\n",
      "the day the Titanic sank. And that makes you\n",
      "my new best friend. These are some of the things\n",
      "we recovered from your stateroom. This was mine. How extraordinary. And it looks the same as it\n",
      "did the last time I saw it. The reflection has\n",
      "changed a bit. Are you ready to go\n",
      "back to Titanic? Okay, here we go. She hits the berg on\n",
      "the starboard side, right? She kind of bumps along... ...punching holes like\n",
      "morse code... -- dit-dit-dit -- along the side... ...below the waterline. Then the forward compartments\n",
      "start to flood. Now, as the water\n",
      "level rises... ...it spills over the\n",
      "watertight bulkheads... which, unfortunately, don't go\n",
      "any higher than E deck- So now as the\n",
      "bow goes down... ...the stern rises up,\n",
      "slow at first... ...then faster and faster... ...until finally, she's got her whole\n",
      "ass sticking up in the air. And that's a big ass. We're talking\n",
      "20, 30,000 tons. Okay? And the hull's not designed\n",
      "to deal with that pressure. So, what happens? She splits, right\n",
      "down to the keel. And the stern... ...falls back level. Then... ...as the bow sinks... ...it pulls the stern vertical... ...and then finally detaches. Now the stern section just kind of bobs\n",
      "there like a cork for a couple of minutes... ...floods, and finally goes\n",
      "under about 2:20 AM... ...2 hours and 40 minutes\n",
      "after the collision. The bow section\n",
      "planes away... ...landing about a\n",
      "half a mile away... ...going 20, 30 knots when\n",
      "it hits the ocean floor. Pretty cool, huh? Thank you for that fine\n",
      "forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course, the\n",
      "experience of it was... ...somewhat different. Will you share it with us? I'm taking her to rest. No. Come on, Nana. No! Give me the\n",
      "tape recorder. Tell us, Rose. It's been 84 years-- It's okay. Just try\n",
      "to remember anything... ...anything at all. Do you want to hear this\n",
      "or not, Mr. Lovett? It's been 84 years... ...and I can still smell\n",
      "the fresh paint. The china had\n",
      "never been used. The sheets had\n",
      "never been slept in. Titanic was called\n",
      "the ship of dreams. And it was. It really was. All third-class\n",
      "passengers... ...with a forward berth... ...this way please!\n",
      "This queue! It's a big boat, huh? Daddy, it's a ship. You're right. I don't see what all\n",
      "the fuss is about. It doesn't look any bigger\n",
      "than the Mauretania. You can be blasé\n",
      "about some things, Rose... ...but not about Titanic. It's over 100 feet longer\n",
      "than Mauretania... ...and far more luxurious. Your daughter is far too\n",
      "difficult to impress, Ruth. So this is the ship they\n",
      "say is unsinkable. It is unsinkable. God Himself\n",
      "could not sink this ship-- Wh at?! You have to check your baggage\n",
      "through the main terminal. It's round that\n",
      "way, sir. I put my faith in\n",
      "you good sir. Now kindly\n",
      "see my man. Yes sir. It's my\n",
      "pleasure, sir. If I can do\n",
      "anything at all... Yes, right. All the trunks from\n",
      "that car there- 12 from here. And the safe,\n",
      "to the parlor suite... ...rooms B-52, 54, 56. Ladies... ...we better hurry. Come along. - My coat?\n",
      "- I have it, miss. All third-class passengers\n",
      "queue here for health inspection. - Welcome aboard, ma'am.\n",
      "- Welcome to Titanic. It was the ship of dreams... ...to everyone else. To me, it was a\n",
      "slave ship... ...taking me back to\n",
      "America in chains. Outwardly, I was everything\n",
      "a Well brought up girl should be- Inside, I was screaming. Jack, you are pazzo. You bet everything\n",
      "we have. When you got nothing,\n",
      "you got nothing to lose. Sven? All right,\n",
      "moment of truth. Someone's life is\n",
      "about to change. Fabrizio? Niente. Olaf? Nothing. Sven? Uh-oh.\n",
      "2 pair. I'm sorry,\n",
      "Fabrizio. I'm sorry... ...you're not gonna see\n",
      "your mom again for a... ...long time... ...'cause we're\n",
      "going to America. Full house, boys! Come on. I'm going home! I'm going home. I go to America! No, mate. Titanic go to America, in 5 minutes. Shit. Fabri.\n",
      "Come on. Come on,\n",
      "here. Here. We're riding in\n",
      "high style now! We're a couple of\n",
      "regular swells. We're practically\n",
      "goddamn royalty... ...ragazzo mio. You see?\n",
      "ls my destine. Like I told you... I go to America to\n",
      "be millionaire. You are pazzo. Maybe, but I've\n",
      "got the tickets. Come on, I thought\n",
      "you were fast. Aspettal Whoa. Wait! Wait! Hey, wait! We're passengers! Have you been through\n",
      "the inspection queue? Of course. Anyway, we\n",
      "don't have any lice. We're Americans.\n",
      "Both of us. Right. Come aboard. We're the luckiest sons\n",
      "of bitches in the world. You know that? Good-bye! You know somebody? Of course not.\n",
      "That's not the point. Good-bye!\n",
      "I'll miss you! Good-bye! I will never forget you! Come with me,\n",
      "darling. Let's go. G-60. G-60. G-60. Excuse me,\n",
      "ma'am. G-60. Oh, right here. Hey, how you doing? Jack. Nice\n",
      "to meet you. Jack Dawson.\n",
      "Nice to meet you. How you doing? Who says you get\n",
      "top bunk, huh? This is your private\n",
      "promenade deck, sir. Will you be requiring\n",
      "anything? Excuse me. - This one?\n",
      "- No. It had a lot of faces on it. This is the one. Would you like all of\n",
      "them out, miss? Yes. We need a little\n",
      "color in this room. Put in there.\n",
      "In the wardrobe. God, not those finger\n",
      "paintings again. They certainly were a\n",
      "waste of money. The difference between\n",
      "Cal's taste in art... ...and mine is that I have some. They're fascinating. Like being inside a dream\n",
      "or something. There's truth but no logic. - What's the artist's name?\n",
      "- Something Picasso. Something Picasso. He won't amount\n",
      "to a thing. He won't, trust me. - Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.\n",
      "- At least they were cheap. Put it in the wardrobe. At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard\n",
      "named Margaret Brown. We all called her Molly. History would call her\n",
      "the Unsinkable Molly Brown. Well, I wasn't about to\n",
      "wait all day for you, sonny. Here, if you think\n",
      "you can manage. Her husband had struck gold\n",
      "someplace out west. And she was what Mother\n",
      "called \"new money.\" By the next afternoon... ...we were steaming west\n",
      "from the coast of Ireland... ...with nothing out ahead\n",
      "of us but ocean. Take herto sea,\n",
      "Mr. Murdoch. Let's stretch her legs. Yes sir. All ahead full, Mr. Moody. Very good, sir. All ahead full. All ahead full! Come on lads,\n",
      "step lively! All right! Let's stoke\n",
      "her right up! We go full ahead! Come on, put your\n",
      "backs into it! 21 knots, sir. Hey, look,\n",
      "look, look! See it? There's another\n",
      "one! See him? Look at that one!\n",
      "Look at him jump! I can see the Statue\n",
      "of Liberty already. Very small,\n",
      "of course. I'm the king\n",
      "of the world! She is the largest moving object\n",
      "ever made by the hand of man... ...in all history. And our master shipbuilder,\n",
      "Mr. Andrews here... ...designed her from the\n",
      "keel plates up. I may have knocked\n",
      "her together, but--- ...the idea was\n",
      "Mr. lsmay's. He envisioned a steamer\n",
      "so grand in scale... ...and so luxurious in... ...its appointments... ...that its supremacy\n",
      "would never be challenged. And here she is. - Willed into solid reality.\n",
      "- Hear, hear. I'll have the salmon. You know I don't\n",
      "like that, Rose. She knows. We'll both have\n",
      "the lamb. Rare, with very\n",
      "little mint sauce. You like lamb,\n",
      "right sweet pea? You gonna cut her meat\n",
      "for her too there, Cal? Hey, who thought of\n",
      "the name Titanic? Was it you,\n",
      "Bruce? Yes, actually. I wanted to convey sheer size.\n",
      "And size means stability... ...luxury, and above\n",
      "all, strength. Do you know of\n",
      "Dr. Freud, Mr. lsmay? His ideas about the male preoccupation\n",
      "with size might be of particular interest to you. What's gotten into you? Excuse me. I do apologize. She's a pistol, Cal.\n",
      "Hope you can handle her. Well, I may have to start minding what she\n",
      "reads from now on, won't I, Mrs. Brown? Freud? Who is he?\n",
      "Is he a passenger? The ship is nice, huh? Yeah. It's an Irish ship. Is English, no? No, it was built\n",
      "in Ireland. 15,000 lrishmen\n",
      "built this ship. Solid as a rock.\n",
      "Big Irish hands. That's typical. First-class dogs\n",
      "come down here to take a shite. Lets us know where we rank\n",
      "in the scheme of things. Like we could forget? I'm Tommy Ryan. - Jack Dawson.\n",
      "- Fabrizio. Do you make any money\n",
      "with your drawings? Ah, forget it, boyo. You'd as like have angels fly out of\n",
      "your arse as get next to... ...the likes of her. I saw my whole life\n",
      "as if I'd already lived it. An endless parade\n",
      "of parties and cotillions... yachts and polo matches. Always the same narrow people,\n",
      "the same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing\n",
      "at a great precipice... ...with no one to pull me back.\n",
      "No one who cared... ...or even noticed. Don't do it. Stay back. Don't come any closer. Come on. Just give me your hand.\n",
      "I'll pull you back over. No!\n",
      "Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go. No, you won't. What do you mean,\n",
      "no I won't? Don't presume to tell me\n",
      "what I will and will not do. You don't know me. Well, you would have done it already. You're distracting me.\n",
      "Go away. I can't. I'm involved now. You let go, and I'm going to have\n",
      "to jump in there after you. Don't be absurd. - You'll be killed.\n",
      "- I'm a good swimmer. The fall alone will kill you. It would hurt. I'm not\n",
      "saying it wouldn't. Tell you the truth... ...I'm a lot more concerned\n",
      "about that water being so cold. How cold? Freezing.\n",
      "Maybe a couple degrees over. You ever, uh... ...ever been\n",
      "to Wisconsin? Wh at? Well, they have some of\n",
      "the coldest winters around. I grew up there,\n",
      "near Chippewa Falls. I remember when I was a kid,\n",
      "me and my father, we went ice fishing... ...out on Lake Wissota. Ice fishing is, you know, where you-- I know what ice fishing is! Sorry. You just seem like, you know,\n",
      "kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I... ...fell through some thin ice. And I'm telling you... ...water that cold, like right down there... ...it hits you like 1000 knives\n",
      "stabbing you all over your body. You can't breathe. You can't think. Least not about\n",
      "anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking\n",
      "forward to jumping in there after you. Like I said... ...I don't have a choice. I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll\n",
      "come back over the rail and... ...and get me off\n",
      "the hook here. You're crazy. That's what everybody says but... ...with all due respect, miss... ...I'm not the one hanging off\n",
      "the back of a ship here. Come on. Come on, give me your hand. You don't want to do this. I'm Jack Dawson. Rose DeWitt Bu kater. I'll have to get you to\n",
      "write that one down. Come on. I got you. Come on. Come on. Help, please! Help! - Please, help me!\n",
      "- Listen. Listen to me. Listen. Listen to me. I've got you.\n",
      "I won't let go. Now pull yourself up.\n",
      "Come on! Come on. That's right. You can do it. I got you. What's all this? You stand back and... ...don't move an inch! Fetch the Master at Arms. This is completely unacceptable! What made you think that you could\n",
      "put your hands on my fiancée?! Look at me, you filth! Cal. What do you think\n",
      "you were doing? Cal, stop.\n",
      "It was an accident. An accident? It was. Stupid, really. I was leaning over and I slipped. I was leaning far over\n",
      "to see the, uh... ...uh, uh, the uh... - Propellers?\n",
      "- Propellers, and I slipped. And I would have gone\n",
      "overboard but Mr. Dawson here... ...saved me. And almost\n",
      "went over himself. You wanted to see the...\n",
      "She wanted to see the propellers. Like I said, women and\n",
      "machinery do not mix. Was that the way of it? Yeah. Yeah, that\n",
      "was pretty much it. Well, the boy's a hero then. Good for you, son.\n",
      "Well done. So, it's all's well and back\n",
      "to our brandy, eh? Look at you. You must be freezing.\n",
      "Let's get you inside. Perhaps a little something\n",
      "for the boy? Of course. Mr. Lovejoy,\n",
      "I think a 20 should do it. Is that the going rate\n",
      "for saving the woman you love? Rose is displeased. What to do? I know. Perhaps you could join us for\n",
      "dinner tomorrow evening... ...to regale our group... ...with your heroic tale. Sure.\n",
      "Count me in. Good.\n",
      "It's settled then. This should be interesting. Can I bum a smoke? You'll want to tie those. It's interesting... ...the young lady slipped\n",
      "so suddenly... ...and you still had time to remove\n",
      "your jacket and your shoes. I know you've been melancholy. I don't pretend to know why. I intended to save this... ...until the engagement\n",
      "gala next week... ...but, I thought... ...tonight. Good gracious. Perhaps as a reminder\n",
      "of my feelings for you. - Is it a--\n",
      "- Diamond. Yes. 56 carats to be exact. It was worn by Louis XVI. And they called\n",
      "it Le Coeur de Ia Mer. - The Heart of the Ocean.\n",
      "- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes. It's overwhelming. Well, it's for royalty. We are royalty, Rose. You know, there's\n",
      "nothing I couldn't give you. There's nothing I'd deny you... ...if you would not deny me. Open your heart to me, Rose. Well, I've been on my own since\n",
      "I was 15, since my folks died. And I had no brothers or sisters or\n",
      "close kin in that part of the country... ...so I lit on out of there and I\n",
      "haven't been back since. You could just call me a\n",
      "tumbleweed blowing in the wind. Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile\n",
      "around this boat deck and... ...chewed over how great the weather's\n",
      "been and how I grew up... ...but I reckon that's not why\n",
      "you came to talk to me, is it? - Mr. Dawson, I--\n",
      "- Jack. Jack. I want to thank you\n",
      "for what you did. Not just for pulling me back,\n",
      "but for your discretion. You're welcome. Look. I know what you\n",
      "must be thinking. Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery? No. No, that's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... ---what could have happened to this girl\n",
      "to make her think she had no way out? Well I... It was everything.\n",
      "It was my whole world and... ...all the people in it. And the inertia of my life,\n",
      "plunging ahead and me... ...powerless to stop it. God,\n",
      "look at that thing. You would have gone\n",
      "straight to the bottom. 500 invitations have gone out. All of Philadelphia society will be there. And all the while I feel I'm... ...standing in the middle\n",
      "of a crowded room... ...screaming at the\n",
      "top of my lungs... ...and no one\n",
      "even looks up. Do you love him? Pardon me? Do you love him? You're being very rude. You\n",
      "shouldn't be asking me this. Well, it's a simple question.\n",
      "Do you love the guy or not? This is not a suitable conversation. VVhy can't you just\n",
      "answer the question? This is absurd. You don't know me\n",
      "and I don't know you... ...and we are not having this\n",
      "conversation at all. You are rude... ...and uncouth and presumptuous\n",
      "and I am leaving now... ...Jack. Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "It's been a pleasure. I sought you out to thank you\n",
      "and now I have thanked you. And you've insulted me. Well, you deserved it. - Right.\n",
      "- Right. I thought you were leaving. I am. You are so annoying. Wait. I don't have to leave. This is\n",
      "my part of the ship. You leave. Well, well, well.\n",
      "Now who's being rude? What is this stupid thing\n",
      "you're carrying around? So, what are you,\n",
      "an artist or something? These are rather good. They're very good, actually. Jack, this is exquisite work. Ah, they didn't think too\n",
      "much of them in old Paree. Paris? You do get around\n",
      "for a p-- Well, a-- a\n",
      "person of limited means. Go on. A poor guy. You can say it. Well, well, well. And these were drawn from life? Well, that's one of the good things about Paris. Lots of girls are willing\n",
      "to take their clothes off. You liked this woman. You used her several times. Well. She had beautiful\n",
      "hands, you see? I think you must have\n",
      "had a love affair with her. No, no, no.\n",
      "Just with her hands. She was a\n",
      "one-legged prostitute. See? She had a good\n",
      "sense of humor though. Oh, and this lady... She used to sit at this bar every night... ...wearing every piece\n",
      "of jewelry she owned... ...just waiting for\n",
      "her long, lost love. We called her Madame Bijoux. See, her clothes are all moth-eaten. Well,\n",
      "you have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people. I see you. And? You wouldn't have jumped. But the purpose of university\n",
      "is to find a suitable husband. Rose has already done that. Look, here comes that\n",
      "vulgar Brown woman. Quickly, get up before\n",
      "she sits with us. Hello, girls. I was hoping\n",
      "I'd catch you at tea. We're awfully sorry,\n",
      "you missed it. The Countess and I were just\n",
      "off to take the air on the boat deck. What a lovely idea.\n",
      "I need to catch up on my gossip. Countess. So, you've not yet lit the\n",
      "last four boilers? No, I don't see\n",
      "the need. We are making excellent time. The press knows the size of Titanic.\n",
      "Now, I want them to marvel at her speed. We must give them\n",
      "something new to print. This maiden voyage\n",
      "of Titanic must... ...make headlines. Mr. lsmay, I would prefer\n",
      "not to push the engines... ...until they've been properly run in. Of course I'm just a passenger. I leave it to your good offices\n",
      "to decide what's best. But what a glorious end to your final crossing... ...if we were to get into New York\n",
      "on Tuesday night... ...and surprise them all.\n",
      "Make the morning papers. Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.? Good man. After that, I worked\n",
      "on a squid boat in Monterey... ...then I went to Los Angeles to the... ...Santa Monica pier\n",
      "and did portraits for 10 cents each. Why can't I be like you? Just head out for the horizon\n",
      "whenever I feel like it. Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier... only if we just talk about it No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer. Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf. But you have to do it like a real cowboy.\n",
      "No sidesaddle stuff. You mean with one leg on each side? Can you show me? Sure, if you like. Teach me to ride like a man. Chew tobacco like a man. And spit like a man. You didn't learn in finishing school? No. Come on, I'll show you. I'll show you how. Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait. I couldn't possibly, Jack. Watch closely. That's disgusting. Your turn That was pitiful.\n",
      "You really have to hawk it back. Get some leverage.\n",
      "Use your arms. Arc your neck. You see the range on that thing? Okay, go. That was better. You have to work on it.\n",
      "Really try to hawk it up. Mother. May I introduce Jack Dawson? Charmed, I'm sure. The others were gracious and curious\n",
      "about the man who'd saved my life. But my mother looked at him like an insect. A dangerous insect\n",
      "which must be squashed quickly. Sounds like you're a good man\n",
      "to have around in a sticky spot. Why do they always insist on announcing\n",
      "dinner like a damn cavalry charge? Shall we go dress, Mother? See you at dinner, Jack. Uh, son? Son! Do you have any idea what you're doing? Not really. You're about to go into the snake pit. What are you going to wear? I figured. Come on. I was right. You and my son\n",
      "are just about the same size. Pretty close. You shine up like a new penny. Good evening, sir. Thousands of tons of Hockley steel\n",
      "are in this ship. - Which part?\n",
      "- All the right ones. Then you're accountable\n",
      "if there's a problem. Where's Rose? She'll be along. There is the Countess. I saw that in a nickelodeon\n",
      "and always wanted to do it. Darling... ...surely you remember Mr. Dawson. It's amazing.\n",
      "You could almost pass for a gentleman. Almost. This is extraordinary. This is a remarkable voyage. - Mad.\n",
      "- Completely lunatic. There's the Countess of Rothes. That's John Jacob Astor... ...the richest man on board. His little wifey, Madeleine,\n",
      "is my age and in a delicate condition. See how she tries to hide it. Quite the scandal. Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,\n",
      "Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim... ...is at home with the children, of course.\n",
      "And over here... ...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designs naughty lingerie,\n",
      "among her many talents. Very popular with the royals. Congratulations. She's splendid. Why, thank you. Escort a lady to dinner? Certainly. Sweet pea, sweet pea. Ain't nothing to it. They love money. Pretend like you own\n",
      "a gold mine and you're in the club. Hey, Astor. Hello, Molly. Nice to see you. J.J., Madeleine,\n",
      "I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson. Well, Jack... ...are you of the Boston Dawsons? No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually. Oh, yes. He must have been nervous,\n",
      "but he never faltered. They assumed he was one of them. Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps. New money, obviously,\n",
      "but still a member of the club. Mother, of course,\n",
      "could always be counted upon. Tell us of the accommodations in steerage\n",
      "Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good- The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats. Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of help to my fiancée last night. It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist. He showed me some of his work today. Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.\n",
      "Not to impugn your work, sir. Are all these mine? Start from the outside and work in. He knows every rivet in her. Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Thank you, Rose. How do you take your caviar, sir? No caviar for me, thanks.\n",
      "Never did like it much. Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson? Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's good humor. How do you have means to travel? I work my way from place to place.\n",
      "Tramp steamers and such. I won my ticket on Titanic\n",
      "at a lucky hand at poker. A very lucky hand. All life is a game of luck. A real man makes his own luck.\n",
      "Right, Dawson? And you find\n",
      "that sort of rootless existence appealing? Yes, ma'am, I do. I've got everything I need\n",
      "right here with me. I have air in my lungs\n",
      "and blank sheets of paper. I love waking up, not knowing\n",
      "what will happen or who I'll meet. Where I'll wind up. One night I'm sleeping under a bridge... ...now I'm on the grandest ship\n",
      "in the world, with you fine people. I'll take more of that. Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it. You never know what hand you'll get dealt. You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal. Make each day count. Well said, Jack. Hear, hear. To making it count. To making it count. Bravo. But Mr. Brown didn't know\n",
      "I'd hidden the money in the stove. He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating\n",
      "and lights a fire. Next is brandy in the smoking room. Join me in a brandy, gentlemen? Now they retreat to congratulate each\n",
      "other on being masters of the universe. Ladies, thank you for your company. May I escort you to the cabin? No, I'll stay here. Here, Molly. Joining us, Dawson? You don't want to stay with the women. No, thanks. I have to head back. That's best. It'll be all business and politics.\n",
      "Wouldn't interest you. But Dawson, good of you to come. Must you go? Time for me to row with the other slaves. Good night, Rose. Want to go to a real party? Is okay I put my hand here? I can't understand you. I'm going to dance with her now. Come on. Come on. Come with me. Jack. Jack, wait. I can't do this. We'll have to get a bit closer. Like this. You're still my best girl, Cora. - I don't know the steps.\n",
      "- Me, either. Just go with it. Don't think. Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack! Wh at? Wait! Jack, no. --Beyond the jurisdiction\n",
      "of the Sherman Act. That's what Rockefeller said--\n",
      "Supreme Court didn't swallow it. What? You think\n",
      "a first-class girl can't drink? Get out of here. Are you all right? I'm fine. Two out of three. So... ...you think you're tough? Let's see you do this. Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up. Jesus! You okay? I haven't done that in years. Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go. Coffee, sir? You didn't come to me last night. I was tired. Your exertions below deck\n",
      "were no doubt exhausting. I see you had\n",
      "that undertaker of a manservant follow me. You will never behave like that again. I'm not one of your mill foremen\n",
      "who you can command. I'm your fiancée. My fiancée. My fiancée! Yes, you are! And my wife! My wife in practice,\n",
      "if not yet by law, so you will honor me! You will honor me the way\n",
      "a wife honors her husband. Because I will not be made a fool of. Is this in any way unclear? No. Good. Excuse me. Oh, Miss Rose. We had a little accident. - That's all right.\n",
      "- I'm sorry. Let me help you. It's all right, miss. It's all right, miss. Tea, Trudy. You're not to see that boy again.\n",
      "You understand? Rose, I forbid it. Stop it, Mother.\n",
      "You'll give yourself a nosebleed. This is not a game. Our situation is precarious.\n",
      "You know the money's gone. Of course I know.\n",
      "You remind me every day. Your father left us nothing but a legacy\n",
      "of bad debts hidden by a good name. That name is the only card we have to play. I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley.\n",
      "It will ensure our survival. How can you put this on me? Why are you being so selfish? I'm being selfish? Do you want to see me\n",
      "working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? To see our fine things sold at auction? Our memories scattered? It's so unfair. Of course it's unfair. We're women. Our choices are never easy. Protect them by Thy guiding hand From every peril on the land O, spirit whom the Father sent To spread abroad the firmament O, wind of heaven, by Thy might Save all who dare the eagle 's ﬂight And keep them by Thy watchful care... Hello, Mr. Andrews. I need to talk to someone. You're not supposed to be in here. I was here last night, remember? No. Now please turn around. He'll tell you. I just need to talk-- Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater... ...are still appreciative of your assistance. They asked me\n",
      "to give you this in gratitude-- I don't want your money. --And remind you you are\n",
      "in third class and your presence here... ...is no longer appropriate. Let me speak to Rose. Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson\n",
      "returns to where he belongs... ...and that he stays there? Yes, sir. Come along, you. Hear us when we cry to Thee For those in peril on the sea Why are there two steering wheels? We use this one near shore. Excuse me, sir.\n",
      "Another ice warning, from the Noordam. Thank you, Sparks. Not to worry.\n",
      "Quite normal for this time of year. In fact, we're speeding up.\n",
      "I've ordered the last boilers lit. Okay, son, wind it up tight\n",
      "like I showed you. That's right. Okay, now let it go. - It was good, wasn't it?\n",
      "- Quite nice. That's excellent. Mr. Andrews...Forgive me. I did the sum\n",
      "in my head... ...and with the number of lifeboats\n",
      "times the capacity you mentioned... Forgive me, but it seems that there are\n",
      "not enough for everyone aboard. About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing,\n",
      "do you? In fact, I put in these new\n",
      "type davits... ...which can take an extra row\n",
      "of boats inside this one. But it was thought,\n",
      "by some... ...the deck would look\n",
      "too cluttered. So, I was overruled. It's a waste of deck space\n",
      "as it is on an unsinkable ship. Sleep soundly, young Rose. I have built you a good ship,\n",
      "strong and true. She's all the lifeboat\n",
      "you need. Just keep heading aft. The next\n",
      "stop will be the engine room. Jack, this is impossible.\n",
      "I can't see you. - I need to talk to you.\n",
      "- No, Jack. No. Jack.\n",
      "I'm engaged. I'm marrying Cal. I love Cal. Rose... ...you're no picnic. All right?\n",
      "You're a spoiled little brat even. But under that, you're the\n",
      "most amazingly, astounding ...wonderful girl... ...woman, that I've ever known. Jack, I-- No, let me try and get\n",
      "this out. You're ama-- I'm not an idiot.\n",
      "I know how the world works. I've got ten bucks\n",
      "in my pocket. I have nothing to offer\n",
      "you and I know that. I understand. But I'm too involved now. You jump, I jump\n",
      "Remember? I can't turn away without\n",
      "knowing you'll be all right. That's all that I want. Well, I'm fine. I'll be fine. Really. Really? I don't think so. They've got you trapped, Rose. And you're gonna die if you\n",
      "don't break free. Maybe not right away... ...because you're strong... ...but sooner or later that\n",
      "fire that I love about you, Rose... ...that fire is gonna\n",
      "burn out. It's not up to you\n",
      "to save me, Jack. You're right. Only you can do that. I'm going back. Leave me alone. Tell Lucile about the disaster\n",
      "you had with the stationers. Well, of course the invitations\n",
      "had to be sent back, twice. Oh, my dear. And the dreadful\n",
      "bridesmaids' gowns. Let me tell you what an\n",
      "odyssey that has been. Rose decided she\n",
      "wanted lavender. She knows I detest the color. So, she did it only to spite me. If only you'd come to\n",
      "me sooner. Ruth saw some of my designs in\n",
      "La Mode Illustrée. They were for the trousseau of the Duchess\n",
      "of Marlborough's youngest daughter. They were quite charming. But, I think you'll agree,\n",
      "my dear, that together... ...we've created something\n",
      "of a phoenix from the ashes. Hello, Jack. I changed my mind. They said you might be up here. Give me your hand. Now close your eyes. Go on. Now, step up. Now, hold onto the railing. Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "Don't peek. I'm not. Now, step up onto the rail. Hold on. Hold on. Keep your eyes closed. Do you trust me? I trust you. All right... ---Open your eyes. I'm flying. Jack. Come, Josephine, in my\n",
      "ﬂying machine. Going up... ...she goes. Up she goes. That was the last time\n",
      "Titanic ever saw daylight. We're up to dusk the\n",
      "night of the sinking. 6 hours to go. Incredible. There's Smith and\n",
      "he's standing there and... ...he's got the iceberg warning\n",
      "in his fucking hand... ...excuse me--his hand,\n",
      "and he's ordering more speed. 26 years of experience\n",
      "working against him. He figures anything big\n",
      "enough to sink, the ship... ...they're gonna see in time to turn. But the ship's too big\n",
      "with too small a rudder. Doesn't corner worth a damn. Everything he knows\n",
      "is wrong. It's quite proper, I assure you.\n",
      "This is the sitting room. - Will this light do?\n",
      "- What? Don't artists need good light? That is true, but I'm not\n",
      "used to working in... ...such horrible conditions. Monet! - Do you know his work?\n",
      "- Of course. Look at his use of color here.\n",
      "Isn't he great? I know. It's extraordinary. Cal insists on carting\n",
      "this hideous thing everywhere. Should we be expecting him\n",
      "any time soon? Not as long as the cigars\n",
      "and brandy hold out. That's nice. What is it,\n",
      "a sapphire? A diamond. A very rare diamond. Jack, I want you to draw me\n",
      "like one of your French girls. Wearing this. All right. Wearing only this. The last thing I need is another picture of me\n",
      "looking like a porcelain doll. As a paying customer... ...I expect to get\n",
      "what I want. Over on the bed\n",
      "...uh, the couch. Come. Lie down. - Tell me when it looks right.\n",
      "- Keep that. Put your arm back\n",
      "the way it was. Put that other arm up,\n",
      "that hand right by your face there. Right. Now, head down. Eyes to me.\n",
      "Keep them on me. And try to stay still. So serious. I believe you are blushing,\n",
      "Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine\n",
      "Monsieur Monet blushing. He does landscapes. - Just relax your face.\n",
      "- Sorry. No laughing. My heart was pounding\n",
      "the whole time. It was the most erotic\n",
      "moment of my life... ...up until then, at least. So what happened next? You mean,\n",
      "did we do it? Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine. Jack was very professional. Thank you. What are you doing? Will you put this\n",
      "back in the safe for me? Gentlemen, would you excuse me. None of the stewards\n",
      "have seen her. This is absurd.\n",
      "It's a ship. There's only so many\n",
      "places she could be. Lovejoy, find her. - Clear.\n",
      "- Yes. I don't think I've ever\n",
      "seen such a flat calm. Like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind. It will make the bergs\n",
      "harder to see--- ...with no breaking\n",
      "water at the base. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and\n",
      "heading, Mr. Lightoller. Yes, sir. It's getting cold.\n",
      "You look nice. Miss Rose? My drawings! Come on! Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait! - Go. Go. Down, down.\n",
      "- Take us down, quickly. Quickly! Bye. Sorry. - Keep going.\n",
      "- Thank you, I've got it. Pretty tough for\n",
      "a valet, this fella. Seems more like a cop. I think he was. - Oh, shit.\n",
      "- Go! No, over here! Quick! Now what? Wh at? More coal for number\n",
      "one, mate. Hold up? What are you two\n",
      "doing down here? You shouldn't be down here. It could be dangerous! Carry on! Don't mind us. You're\n",
      "doing a great job! Keep up the good work! Look at what we have here, huh? Thank you. Where to, miss? To the stars. You nervous? No. Put your hands on me, Jack. It's bloody cold. You know, I can smell ice, you know.\n",
      "When it's near. Bollocks! Well, I can, all right? Did you ever find those\n",
      "binoculars for the lookouts? Haven't seen them\n",
      "since Southampton. Well, I'll be on\n",
      "my rounds. Cheerio. You're trembling. Don't worry. I'll be all right. - They ran down there.\n",
      "- Right. Anything missing? I have a better idea. GOI you! Did you see those guys' faces? Did you see them? When the ship docks... ...I'm getting off with you. This is crazy. I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it. Here, look at this. Look at that, would you? They're warmer than we are. If that's what it takes for us to get warm,\n",
      "I'd rather not. Bugger me! Pick up, you bastards! Is anyone there?! What do you see? Iceberg, right ahead! Thank you. Iceberg ahead! Hard a' starboard! Turn! Turn! Srnartly! Full astern! Hard over. Helm's hard over, sir. Go, lads, go! Bring that steam down! Bring it down! Shut all the dampers! Shut them! Hold it. Hold it! Now! Engage reversing engine! Why ain't they turning? Is it hard over?! It is, sir. Hard over. Come on, come on, come on. Turn. Yes. It's going to hit! Jesus Christ! Jesus! Hard to port! Hard to port! Get back! Let's go! They're closing the doors! Get out! Get out the door! Go! Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go! Go! Go! Out! Out! Oh, my God. That was a close shave. Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ! Note the time. Enter it in the log. What was that, Mr. Murdoch? An iceberg, sir. I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close. I tried to port round it, but-- - Close the watertight doors.\n",
      "- They're closed, sir. All stop. Have the carpenter sound the ship. Come on, let's get the hell out of here! Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder. Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade. That's the shudder you felt.\n",
      "Do you need anything? No, thank you. There's talk of an iceberg. I don't see anything. Do you? If this is where the rats are going, I am, too. - You.\n",
      "- There is no emergency. - There is. I've been robbed.\n",
      "- Get the Master at Arms. Now, you moron! Did I miss the fun? - Did you see what happened?\n",
      "- No- I guess it hit over there- Boiler room six is flooded eight feet\n",
      "and the mail hold is worse. - Can you shore up?\n",
      "- Not unless the pumps get ahead. - Have you seen the mail hold?\n",
      "- It's already underwater. This is bad. We should tell Mother and Cal. I think they're very good, sir. Don't touch anything.\n",
      "I want the room photographed. We've been looking for you, miss. Here we go. Something serious has happened. Yes, it has. Indeed.\n",
      "Two things dear to me have disappeared. Now that one is back,\n",
      "I know where to find the other. Search him. - Take your coat off.\n",
      "- Now what? What are you doing?\n",
      "We're in the middle of an emergency. - Is this it?\n",
      "- That's it. This is horseshit! Don't you believe it. - He couldn't have.\n",
      "- Easy enough for a professional. I was with him the entire time. Perhaps he did it while you were putting\n",
      "your clothes back on, dear. Real slick. They put it in my pocket. - Shut up.\n",
      "- It isn't even your pocket. \"Property of A.L. Ryerson.\" That was reported stolen. I just borrowed it. Oh, we have an honest thief. You know I didn't do this, Rose. Don't believe them. You know it. Let's go, son. You know I didn't do it! There's a good lad. Come on. You know I didn't do it! You know me! This is most unfortunate, Captain. Water fourteen feet above the keel\n",
      "in ten minutes... ...in the forepeak,\n",
      "all three holds and boiler room six. That's right. When can we get underway? That's five compartments. She can float with four compartments breached,\n",
      "but not five. Not five. As she goes down,\n",
      "the water will spill... ...over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,\n",
      "one to the next... ...back and back. There's no stopping it. The pumps. The pumps buy you time, but minutes only. As of now, no matter what we do... ...Titanic will founder. But this ship can't sink. She's made of iron. I assure you, she can. And she will. It's a mathematical certainty. How much time? An hour. Two, at most. How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch? Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir. Well, I believe you may get your headlines,\n",
      "Mr. lsmay. Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it? Look at me when I'm talking to you! - Mr. Hockley?\n",
      "- Not now. We're busy. You've been asked to put on lifebelts\n",
      "and go to the boat deck. I said, not now. I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.\n",
      "Dress warmly. It's quite cold out. May I suggest topcoats and hats? This is ridiculous. Not to worry, miss.\n",
      "I'm sure it's just a precaution. Everybody up! Lifebelts on! What's he on about? - Put your lifebelts on!\n",
      "- What is it? Just put them on. C.O.D.? Sir? That's right, C.O.D. The distress call.\n",
      "That's our position. Tell whoever responds we're going down\n",
      "and need immediate assistance. Blimey. Keep lowering! Keep lowering! Steady! Make it taut! And winch out! Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft! Release those ties! Roll back that cover! Smartly now! Where are the passengers? They went inside- Too cold and noisy for them You there! Get down here\n",
      "and help with these lines! Care for a drink, sir? Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed up\n",
      "and now we're cooling our heels. Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out. Nobody knows what's going on. Just like the damn English--everything by the book. No need for language, Mr. Hockley. Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.\n",
      "I want a cup of tea when I return. Mr. Andrews. I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth. The ship will sink. You're certain? In an hour or so, all this\n",
      "will be at the bottom of the Atlantic. Please, tell only who you must.\n",
      "I don't want to cause a panic. And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats? Yes. I understand. Over here, son. Sir, there's a big mob\n",
      "at the Second Class Purser's office. Go on. I'll watch him. Aye. Right. Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.\n",
      "Full steam for them, sir. She's the only one responding? The only one close. They'll be here in four hours. Four hours?! Thank you, Bride. My God. We are swung out and ready, sir. Hadn't we better get the women and children\n",
      "into the boats? Yes. Women and children first, yes. Yes, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please! Step this way, please. That's right. Come towards me. Thank you. Good. For the time being,\n",
      "I require only women and children Right here. Like the Captain said,\n",
      "nice and cheery, so there's no panic. \"Wedding Dance.\" Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on. Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around. It isn't time to go to the boats yet! Please, stay calm. Make sure you have your lifebelts on. Let women and children through to the front. What are we doing? Waiting. Once first-class people\n",
      "are in the boats... ...they'll start with us and we want to be ready. Pushing won't get you out any faster. Go get help. Lower it away, left and right together! Steady. Both sides together! Steady! Steady! Steady! Stop, stop, stop! Hold the left! Right side only! Right side only! Right side! Hold the left! Right side down!\n",
      "Lower away together! Steady, lads! You know, I do believe this ship may sink. I've been asked to give you\n",
      "this small token of our appreciation. Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley. Come on, sister, you heard\n",
      "the man. Into the boat. Any room for a gentleman,\n",
      "gentlemen? Only women at this time, sir. Will the lifeboats be\n",
      "seated according to class? I hope they're not too crowded. Oh, Mother, shut up! Don't you understand? The water is freezing and\n",
      "there aren't enough boats. Not enough by half. Half the people on this\n",
      "ship are going to die. Not the better half. Come on, Ruth,\n",
      "get in the boat. First class seats\n",
      "are right up here. You know, it's a pity I didn't\n",
      "keep that drawing. It'll be worth a lot\n",
      "more by morning. You unimaginable bastard. Come on, Rose darling.\n",
      "There's plenty of room for you. Come on, Rose. You're next, darling. Come into the boat, Rose. Come. Rose. Get into the boat! Rose. Good-bye, Mother. Where are you going? To him?! To be a whore\n",
      "to a gutter rat? I'd rather be his whore\n",
      "than your wife. No! I said, no! Rose!\n",
      "Please, stop! And, lower away! No, Wait! Lower away! - Rose!\n",
      "- Lower together! Hold the left side! Help! Can anybody hear me?! Hello! Help me! Help me! Can you hear me?! Can anybody hear me?!\n",
      "Somebody help me! Mr. Andrews?! Steward, check the\n",
      "starboard corridor. Madame, please put on a lifebelt.\n",
      "Get to the boat deck immediately. Lucy, for God's sake put on your\n",
      "lifebelt and set a good example. Yes sir. - Anyone in here?\n",
      "- Mr. Andrews! Mr. Andrews!\n",
      "Thank God! Where would the Master at Arms\n",
      "take someone under arrest? What? You have to get\n",
      "to a boat right away. No! I'm doing this with or\n",
      "without your help, sir. But without will take longer. Take the elevator to the\n",
      "very bottom. Go to the left... ...down the crewmen's passage. Then go right and left\n",
      "again at the stairs. You'll come\n",
      "to a long corridor. This could be bad. Oh, shit!\n",
      "Oh, shit! Excuse me. Thank you. I'm sorry, miss,\n",
      "but the lifts are closed. I'm through being polite,\n",
      "goddamnit! Now take me down! E deck. Come on. Come on, come on. I'm going back up. No! No! No! Come back!\n",
      "I'm going back up! I'm going back up! Crew passage. Jack! Rose! Rose, I'm in here! I'm in here! I'm in here! Jack! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That guy Lovejoy put\n",
      "it in my pocket. I know, I know, I know. Listen Rose... ...you're gonna have to find\n",
      "the spare key, all right? Look in that\n",
      "cabinet right there. It's a little silver one, Rose. These are all\n",
      "brass ones! Check right here, Rose. Rose. How did you find out I didn't do it? I didn't. I just realized\n",
      "I already knew. Keep looking. No key. There's no key! All right, Rose, listen. You're gonna have\n",
      "to go find some help. It'll be all right. I'll be right back. I'll just wait here! Hello?\n",
      "ls there anyone here? Hello? Is there anybody\n",
      "down here? We need help! Hello? Damnit! Can anybody hear me, please?!\n",
      "Hello?! Hello?! Oh, thank God. Wait, please, I need your help. There's a man back\n",
      "here and he's-- Wait! Hello?! Hello? Miss, you shouldn't\n",
      "be here now. I need your help. There is a man down\n",
      "here and he is trapped. - This way, yes. All right.\n",
      "- Please! - There's no need to panic.\n",
      "- No, I'm not panicking! You're going the\n",
      "wrong way! Let go of me!\n",
      "Listen!!! To hell with you. Oh, my God. Will this work? I guess we'll\n",
      "find out. Come on. Wait, wait, wait. Try a couple practice\n",
      "swings over there. Good. Now try and hit the same mark\n",
      "again, Rose. You can do it. Okay, that's enough practice.\n",
      "Come on, Rose. You can do it. Listen, just hit it really hard\n",
      "and really fast. Come on. Wait. Open your\n",
      "hands up a little more. - Like that?\n",
      "- Right. Listen, Rose,\n",
      "I trust you. Go. You did it! Come on. Let's go. Oh shit, this is cold!\n",
      "Oh, shit! Shit! Shit! This is the way out. We have to find\n",
      "another way. Come on. Pull. Put your backs into it. Pull! Now, there's something\n",
      "you don't see every day. What's this luggage doing here?\n",
      "Get rid of it. Get rid of it. We need the room.\n",
      "Get rid of that. Out. This way.\n",
      "Let go, sir. Get back. Keep calm! Lovejoy! She's not on the starboard side either. We're running out of time. This strutting\n",
      "martinet isn't letting any men on at all. There's one on the other\n",
      "side letting men on. Well then, that's our play. We'll need some\n",
      "insurance first. Come on. This way, please.\n",
      "All the way down here. Here! What do you\n",
      "think you're doing? You'll have to pay for\n",
      "that, you know. That's White Star\n",
      "Line property. Shut up! Will you hold the boat a moment?\n",
      "I just have to run back to my room-- Sit down! She's the last. - Prepare to lower.\n",
      "- Mr. Lightoller. Why are the boats being\n",
      "launched half full? Not now, Mr. Andrews. There, look. 20 or so\n",
      "in a boat built for 65? And I saw one boat\n",
      "with only 12. 12! Well, we weren't sure of\n",
      "the weight, Mr. Andrews. These boats may\n",
      "buckle. Rubbish! They were tested in Belfast\n",
      "with the weight of 70 men. Now, fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.\n",
      "For God's sake man! Please, I need more women\n",
      "and children, please! Get back in there! This is not an exit.\n",
      "This is not an exit. You can't keep us locked in here.\n",
      "Like animals. The ship's bloody sinking. Bring forward the women! Unlock the gates. Women only! No men! No men! Get back! Get back! Lock the gates! Get them back\n",
      "from those gates! Don't touch the gates! For God's sake, man... ...there are women and\n",
      "children down here! Let us up so we can have a chance! Get back! Tommy! - Can we get out?\n",
      "- It's hopeless that way. Whatever we do,\n",
      "we've got to do it fast. The boats are all going. This whole place is flooding.\n",
      "We've gotta get out of here. There is niente this way. Let's go this way, all right?\n",
      "Come on! I make my own luck. So do I. Come on! No, come on, let's go this way. This way! Just go back to\n",
      "the main stairwell. And everything will be\n",
      "sorted out there. It will all get sorted out back there. Go back to the main stairwell. - Open the gate!\n",
      "- Go back down the main stairwell. Open the gate right now! Go back down the main\n",
      "stairwell, like I told you. Goddamn it! Son of a bitch! Stop that! Fabri, Tommy,\n",
      "give me a hand here. Move aside. Come on, pull! Pull! Move aside.\n",
      "Quickly, move aside! Put that down! - Move aside!\n",
      "- Put that down! One! Two! Three! Again! Now, let's go! Let's go, Rose. You can't go up there!\n",
      "You can't do this! Keep order! Keep order here! Back! Back! Back! Hold on to her! Pull her in! Get back, I say, or I'll... ...shoot you all like dogs! Keep order here! Keep order, I say. Mr. Lowe, man this boat. Right. ls everybody all right?\n",
      "Nobody panic. Stay back. We're too late. There are more boats down the front.\n",
      "Stay with this one. Murdoch. He seems to be quite practical. Don't lower it! Cut the falls! Sit down! Stay back, you lot! Just stay back, the\n",
      "lot of you! Stay back! It's starting to fall apart.\n",
      "We don't have much time. Mr. Murdoch? Mr. Hockley.\n",
      "You two, with me, now! I'm a businessman, as you know... ...and I have a business\n",
      "proposition for you. Come on, Rose. The boats are gone! Colonel, are there\n",
      "any boats on that side? No, miss, but there are a couple\n",
      "of boats all the way forward. This way, I'll lead you. What's the use?\n",
      "Nobody's listening to us anyway. Well, they don't listen to\n",
      "us at dinner, either. Come on, let's play. Keep us warm. \"Orpheus.\" Music to drown by.\n",
      "Now I know I'm in first class. - Where is everyone?\n",
      "- They're all still aft, sir. We have an understanding\n",
      "then, Mr. Murdoch. Will the men please hold\n",
      "back! Hold back, I say! Women and children only! Get back! Come through, madame.\n",
      "This way. Step back, sir! You better check the\n",
      "other side. Go! I found her, on the other side. Waiting for a boat. With him. - Any more women and children?\n",
      "- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch. Anyone else then? - Anyone else?\n",
      "- Do hurry. Hurry along. Goddamn it all to hell. Shit. Fire! Sir, sir, you can't\n",
      "go through here. That's it.\n",
      "Splendid. Right. Prepare to lower. Ready on the left. Take them down. Keep it steady. Both sides together.\n",
      "Steady. Keep it steady. - Give her to me.\n",
      "- Daddy. It'll be fine, darling.\n",
      "Don't you worry. Daddy, get in the boat. It's good-bye for a little\n",
      "while. Only for a little while. There'll be another\n",
      "boat for the daddies. This boat is for the\n",
      "mummies and the children. You hold Mummy's hand\n",
      "and be a good little girl. I'm not going without you. No, you have\n",
      "to go, now. Get in the\n",
      "boat, Rose. No, Jack. Yes. Get on the boat! Yes, get on\n",
      "the boat, Rose. Oh my God, look at you. You look a fright. Here. Put this on. Come. Go on. I'll get the next one. No, not without you. I'll be all right.\n",
      "Listen, I'll be fine. I'm a survivor, all right?\n",
      "Don't worry about me. Now, go on.\n",
      "Get on. I have an arrangement with an\n",
      "officer on the other side of the ship. Jack and I can\n",
      "get off safely. Both of us. See? I got my own\n",
      "boat to catch. Go on, hurry. They're almost full. - Step aboard, miss.\n",
      "- Go. Go. Step aboard, please. You're daddy's\n",
      "good girl, all right? You're my little sailor. Clear the rail, please. And, lower away! You're a good liar. Almost as good as you. There's no-- there's no\n",
      "arrangement, is there? No, there is. Not that you'll benefit much from it. I always win, Jack. One way or another. Rose! Stop her! Rose, what\n",
      "are you doing?! No! Rose! You're so stupid!\n",
      "Why did you do that, huh? You're so stupid, Rose. Why did you\n",
      "do that? Why?! You jump,\n",
      "I lump, right? Right. Oh God.\n",
      "I couldn't go. I couldn't\n",
      "go, Jack. It's all right. We'll\n",
      "think of something. - At least I'm with you.\n",
      "- We'll think of something. Come on! Move! Come on!\n",
      "Move. Come on! Move! Come on!\n",
      "Come on Rose. Rose, come on! Move Rose! Go! I hope you enjoy your time together! What could\n",

Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. And she explains the whole story from departure until the death of Titanic on its first and last voyage April 15th, 1912 at 2:20 in the morning.</p>\n",

      "<br>An actress.\n",
      "There's your first clue, Sherlock.\n",
      "<br>Her name was Rose Dawson back then.\n",

      "<br>They move to Cedar Rapids\n",

      "of the Crown...\n",
      "<br>...which disappeared\n",
      "in 1792...\n",
      "<br>...about the same time old Louis lost\n",
      "everything from the neck up.\n",
      "<br>The theory goes that the\n",
      "crown diamond was chopped, too.\n",
      "<br>Recut into a heart-like shape that\n",
      "became known as...\n",
      "<br>...the Heart of the Ocean.\n",
      "<br>Today it would be worth\n",
      "more than the Hope diamond.\n",
      "<br>It was a dreadful,\n",
      "heavy thing.\n",
      "<br>I only wore it this once.\n",
      "<br>You actually think\n",
      "this is you, Nana?\n",
      "<br>It is me, dear.\n",
      "<br>Wasn't I a dish?\n",
      "<br>I tracked it down\n",
      "through insurance records.\n",
      "<br>An old claim that was settled\n",
      "under terms of absolute secrecy.\n",
      "<br>Can you tell me who the\n",
      "claimant was, Rose?\n",
      "<br>I should imagine someone\n",
      "named Hockley.\n",
      "<br>Nathan Hockley,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "<br>Pittsburgh steel tycoon.\n",
      "<br>The claim was for a\n",
      "diamond necklace his son...\n",
      "<br>...Caledon, bought his fiancée.\n",
      "<br>You.\n",
      "<br>A week before he\n",
      "sailed on Titanic.\n",
      "<br>And it was filed right\n",
      "after the sinking.\n",
      "<br>So the diamond had to have\n",
      "gone down with the ship.\n",
      "<br>You see the date?\n",
      "<br>April 14, 1912\n",
      "<br>Which means if your grandmother\n",
      "is who she says she is...\n",
      "<br>...she was wearing the diamond\n",
      "the day the Titanic sank.\n",
      "<br>And that makes you\n",
      "my new best friend.\n",
      "<br>These are some of the things\n",
      "we recovered from your stateroom.\n",
      "<br>This was mine.\n",
      "<br>How extraordinary.\n",
      "<br>And it looks the same as it\n",
      "did the last time I saw it.\n",
      "<br>The reflection has\n",
      "changed a bit.\n",
      "<br>Are you ready to go\n",
      "back to Titanic?\n",
      "<br>Okay, here we go.\n",
      "<br>She hits the berg on\n",
      "the starboard side, right?\n",
      "<br>She kind of bumps along...\n",
      "<br>...punching holes like\n",
      "morse code...\n",
      "<br>-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...\n",
      "<br>...below the waterline.\n",
      "<br>Then the forward compartments\n",
      "start to flood.\n",
      "<br>Now, as the water\n",
      "level rises...\n",
      "<br>...it spills over the\n",
      "watertight bulkheads...\n",
      "<br>which, unfortunately, don't go\n",
      "any higher than E deck-\n",
      "<br>So now as the\n",
      "bow goes down...\n",
      "<br>...the stern rises up,\n",
      "slow at first...\n",
      "<br>...then faster and faster...\n",
      "<br>...until finally, she's got her whole\n",
      "ass sticking up in the air.\n",
      "<br>And that's a big ass.\n",
      "<br>We're talking\n",
      "20, 30,000 tons. Okay?\n",
      "<br>And the hull's not designed\n",
      "to deal with that pressure.\n",
      "<br>So, what happens?\n",
      "<br>She splits, right\n",
      "down to the keel.\n",
      "<br>And the stern...\n",
      "<br>...falls back level.\n",
      "<br>Then...\n",
      "<br>...as the bow sinks...\n",
      "<br>...it pulls the stern vertical...\n",
      "<br>...and then finally detaches.\n",
      "<br>Now the stern section just kind of bobs\n",
      "there like a cork for a couple of minutes...\n",
      "<br>...floods, and finally goes\n",
      "under about 2:20 AM...\n",
      "<br>...2 hours and 40 minutes\n",
      "after the collision.\n",
      "<br>The bow section\n",
      "planes away...\n",
      "<br>...landing about a\n",
      "half a mile away...\n",
      "<br>...going 20, 30 knots when\n",
      "it hits the ocean floor.\n",
      "<br>Pretty cool, huh?\n",
      "<br>Thank you for that fine\n",
      "forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.\n",
      "<br>Of course, the\n",
      "experience of it was...\n",
      "<br>...somewhat different.\n",
      "<br>Will you share it with us?\n",
      "<br>I'm taking her to rest.\n",
      "<br>No.\n",
      "<br>Come on, Nana.\n",
      "<br>No!\n",
      "<br>Give me the\n",
      "tape recorder.\n",
      "<br>Tell us, Rose.\n",
      "<br>It's been 84 years--\n",
      "<br>It's okay. Just try\n",
      "to remember anything...\n",
      "<br>...anything at all.\n",
      "<br>Do you want to hear this\n",
      "or not, Mr. Lovett?\n",
      "<br>It's been 84 years...\n",
      "<br>...and I can still smell\n",
      "the fresh paint.\n",
      "<br>The china had\n",
      "never been used.\n",
      "<br>The sheets had\n",

      "<br>I don't see what all\n",

      "<br>You can be blasé\n",
      "about some things, Rose...\n",
      "<br>...but not about Titanic.\n",

      "<br>You let go, and I'm going to have\n",
      "to jump in there after you.\n",
      "<br>Don't be absurd.\n",
      "<br>- You'll be killed.\n",
      "- I'm a good swimmer.\n",
      "<br>The fall alone will kill you.\n",
      "<br>It would hurt. I'm not\n",
      "saying it wouldn't.\n",
      "<br>Tell you the truth...\n",
      "<br>...I'm a lot more concerned\n",
      "about that water being so cold.\n",
      "<br>How cold?\n",
      "<br>Freezing.\n",
      "Maybe a couple degrees over.\n",
      "<br>You ever, uh...\n",
      "<br>...ever been\n",
      "to Wisconsin?\n",
      "<br>Wh at?\n",
      "<br>Well, they have some of\n",
      "the coldest winters around.\n",
      "<br>I grew up there,\n",
      "near Chippewa Falls.\n",
      "<br>I remember when I was a kid,\n",
      "me and my father, we went ice fishing...\n",
      "<br>...out on Lake Wissota.\n",
      "<br>Ice fishing is, you know, where you--\n",
      "<br>I know what ice fishing is!\n",
      "<br>Sorry.\n",
      "<br>You just seem like, you know,\n",
      "kind of an indoor girl.\n",
      "<br>Anyway, I...\n",
      "<br>...fell through some thin ice.\n",
      "<br>And I'm telling you...\n",
      "<br>...water that cold,\n",
      "<br>like right down there...\n",
      "<br>...it hits you like 1000 knives\n",
      "stabbing you all over your body.\n",
      "<br>You can't breathe.\n",
      "<br>You can't think. Least not about\n",
      "anything but the pain.\n",
      "<br>Which is why I'm not looking\n",
      "forward to jumping in there after you.\n",
      "<br>Like I said...\n",
      "<br>...I don't have a choice.\n",
      "<br>I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll\n",
      "come back over the rail and...\n",
      "<br>...and get me off\n",
      "the hook here.\n",
      "<br>You're crazy.\n",
      "<br>That's what everybody says but...\n",
      "<br>...with all due respect, miss...\n",
      "<br>...I'm not the one hanging off\n",
      "the back of a ship here.\n",
      "<br>Come on.\n",
      "<br>Come on, give me your hand.\n",
      "<br>You don't want to do this.\n",
      "<br>I'm Jack Dawson.\n",
      "<br>Rose DeWitt Bu kater.\n",
      "<br>I'll have to get you to\n",
      "write that one down.\n",

      "<br>That's right.\n",
      "<br>You can do it.\n",

      "<br>Fetch the Master at Arms.\n",
      "<br>This is completely unacceptable!\n",
      "<br>What made you think that you could\n",

      "<br>Cal.\n",
      "<br>What do you think\n",

      "<br>Cal, stop.\n",
      "It was an accident.\n",
      "<br>An accident?\n",
      "<br>It was.\n",
      "<br>Stupid, really.\n",
      "<br>I was leaning over and I slipped.\n",
      "<br>I was leaning far over\n",
      "to see the, uh...\n",
      "<br>...uh, uh, the uh...\n",
      "<br>- Propellers?\n",
      "- Propellers, and I slipped.\n",
      "<br>And I would have gone\n",
      "overboard but Mr. Dawson here...\n",
      "<br>...saved me. And almost\n",
      "went over himself.\n",
      "<br>You wanted to see the...\n",
      "She wanted to see the propellers.\n",
      "<br>Like I said, women and\n",
      "machinery do not mix.\n",
      "<br>Was that the way of it?\n",
      "<br>Yeah. Yeah, that\n",
      "was pretty much it.\n",
      "<br>Well, the boy's a hero then.\n",
      "<br>Good for you, son.\n",
      "Well done.\n",
      "<br>So, it's all's well and back\n",
      "to our brandy, eh?\n",
      "<br>Look at you. You must be freezing.\n",
      "Let's get you inside.\n",
      "<br>Perhaps a little something\n",
      "for the boy?\n",
      "<br>Of course.\n",
      "<br>Mr. Lovejoy,\n",
      "I think a 20 should do it.\n",
      "<br>Is that the going rate\n",
      "for saving the woman you love?\n",
      "<br>Rose is displeased.\n",
      "<br>What to do?\n",
      "<br>I know.\n",
      "<br>Perhaps you could join us for\n",
      "dinner tomorrow evening...\n",
      "<br>...to regale our group...\n",
      "<br>...with your heroic tale.\n",
      "<br>Sure.\n",
      "Count me in.\n",
      "<br>Good.\n",
      "It's settled then.\n",
      "<br>This should be interesting.\n",
      "<br>Can I bum a smoke?\n",
      "<br>You'll want to tie those.\n",
      "<br>It's interesting...\n",
      "<br>...the young lady slipped\n",
      "so suddenly...\n",
      "<br>...and you still had time to remove\n",
      "your jacket and your shoes.\n",
      "<br>I know you've been melancholy.\n",
      "<br>I don't pretend to know why.\n",
      "<br>I intended to save this...\n",

      "<br>...but, I thought...\n",
      "<br>...tonight.\n",
      "<br>Good gracious.\n",
      "<br>Perhaps as a reminder\n",
      "of my feelings for you.\n",

      "- Diamond. Yes.\n",
      "<br>56 carats to be exact.\n",
      "<br>It was worn by Louis XVI.\n",
      "<br>And they called\n",

      "- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.\n",
      "<br>It's overwhelming.\n",
      "<br>Well, it's for royalty.\n",
      "<br>We are royalty, Rose.\n",
      "<br>You know, there's\n",
      "nothing I couldn't give you.\n",
      "<br>There's nothing I'd deny you...\n",
      "<br>...if you would not deny me.\n",
      "<br>Open your heart to me, Rose.\n",
      "<br>Well, I've been on my own since\n",
      "I was 15, since my folks died.\n",
      "<br>And I had no brothers or sisters or\n",
      "close kin in that part of the country...\n",
      "<br>...so I lit on out of there and I\n",
      "haven't been back since.\n",
      "<br>You could just call me a\n",

      "<br>Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile\n",
      "around this boat deck and...\n",
      "<br>...chewed over how great the weather's\n",
      "been and how I grew up...\n",
      "<br>...but I reckon that's not why\n",
      "you came to talk to me, is it?\n",

      "- Jack.\n",
      "<br>Jack.\n",
      "<br>I want to thank you\n",
      "for what you did.\n",
      "<br>Not just for pulling me back,\n",
      "but for your discretion.\n",
      "<br>You're welcome.\n",
      "<br>Look.\n",
      "<br>I know what you\n",
      "must be thinking.\n",
      "<br>Poor little rich girl.\n",
      "<br>What does she know about misery?\n",
      "<br>No.\n",
      "<br>No, that's not what I was thinking.\n",
      "<br>What I was thinking was...\n",
      "<br>---what could have happened to this girl\n",
      "to make her think she had no way out?\n",
      "<br>Well I...\n",
      "<br>It was everything.\n",
      "It was my whole world and...\n",
      "<br>...all the people in it.\n",
      "<br>And the inertia of my life,\n",
      "plunging ahead and me...\n",
      "<br>...powerless to stop it.\n",
      "<br>God,\n",
      "look at that thing.\n",
      "<br>You would have gone\n",
      "straight to the bottom.\n",
      "<br>500 invitations have gone out.\n",
      "<br>All of Philadelphia society will be there.\n",
      "<br>And all the while I feel I'm...\n",
      "<br>...standing in the middle\n",
      "of a crowded room...\n",
      "<br>...screaming at the\n",
      "top of my lungs...\n",
      "<br>...and no one\n",
      "even looks up.\n",
      "<br>Do you love him?\n",
      "<br>Pardon me?\n",
      "<br>Do you love him?\n",
      "<br>You're being very rude. You\n",
      "shouldn't be asking me this.\n",
      "<br>Well, it's a simple question.\n",
      "Do you love the guy or not?\n",
      "<br>This is not a suitable conversation.\n",
      "<br>VVhy can't you just\n",
      "answer the question?\n",
      "<br>This is absurd.\n",
      "<br>You don't know me\n",
      "and I don't know you...\n",
      "<br>...and we are not having this\n",
      "conversation at all. You are rude...\n",
      "<br>...and uncouth and presumptuous\n",
      "and I am leaving now...\n",
      "<br>...Jack. Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "It's been a pleasure.\n",
      "<br>I sought you out to thank you\n",
      "and now I have thanked you.\n",

      "<br>Well, you deserved it.\n",
      "<br>- Right.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "<br>I thought you were leaving.\n",
      "<br>I am.\n",
      "<br>You are so annoying.\n",
      "<br>Wait.\n",
      "<br>I don't have to leave. This is\n",
      "my part of the ship. You leave.\n",
      "<br>Well, well, well.\n",
      "Now who's being rude?\n",
      "<br>What is this stupid thing\n",
      "you're carrying around?\n",
      "<br>So, what are you,\n",
      "an artist or something?\n",
      "<br>These are rather good.\n",
      "<br>They're very good, actually.\n",
      "<br>Jack, this is exquisite work.\n",
      "<br>Ah, they didn't think too\n",
      "much of them in old Paree.\n",
      "<br>Paris?\n",
      "<br>You do get around\n",
      "for a p--\n",
      "<br>Well, a-- a\n",

      "<br>Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.\n",
      "<br>Well, well, well.\n",
      "<br>And these were drawn from life?\n",
      "<br>Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.\n",
      "<br>Lots of girls are willing\n",
      "to take their clothes off.\n",
      "<br>You liked this woman.\n",
      "<br>You used her several times.\n",
      "<br>Well.\n",
      "<br>She had beautiful\n",
      "hands, you see?\n",
      "<br>I think you must have\n",
      "had a love affair with her.\n",
      "<br>No, no, no.\n",
      "Just with her hands.\n",
      "<br>She was a\n",
      "one-legged prostitute.\n",
      "<br>See?\n",
      "<br>She had a good\n",
      "sense of humor though.\n",
      "<br>Oh, and this lady...\n",
      "<br>She used to sit at this bar every night...\n",
      "<br>...wearing every piece\n",
      "of jewelry she owned...\n",
      "<br>...just waiting for\n",
      "her long, lost love.\n",
      "<br>We called her Madame Bijoux.\n",
      "<br>See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.\n",
      "<br>Well,\n",
      "you have a gift, Jack.\n",
      "<br>You do.\n",
      "<br>You see people.\n",
      "<br>I see you.\n",
      "<br>And?\n",
      "<br>You wouldn't have jumped.\n",
      "<br>But the purpose of university\n",
      "is to find a suitable husband.\n",
      "<br>Rose has already done that.\n",
      "<br>Look, here comes that\n",
      "vulgar Brown woman.\n",
      "<br>Quickly, get up before\n",
      "she sits with us.\n",
      "<br>Hello, girls. I was hoping\n",
      "I'd catch you at tea.\n",
      "<br>We're awfully sorry,\n",
      "you missed it.\n",
      "<br>The Countess and I were just\n",
      "off to take the air on the boat deck.\n",
      "<br>What a lovely idea.\n",
      "I need to catch up on my gossip.\n",
      "<br>Countess.\n",
      "<br>So, you've not yet lit the\n",
      "last four boilers?\n",
      "<br>No, I don't see\n",
      "the need.\n",
      "<br>We are making excellent time.\n",
      "<br>The press knows the size of Titanic.\n",
      "Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.\n",
      "<br>We must give them\n",
      "something new to print.\n",
      "<br>This maiden voyage\n",
      "of Titanic must...\n",

      "<br>Mr. lsmay, I would prefer\n",
      "not to push the engines...\n",
      "<br>...until they've been properly run in.\n",
      "<br>Of course I'm just a passenger.\n",
      "<br>I leave it to your good offices\n",
      "to decide what's best.\n",
      "<br>But what a glorious end to your final crossing...\n",
      "<br>...if we were to get into New York\n",
      "on Tuesday night...\n",
      "<br>...and surprise them all.\n",
      "Make the morning papers.\n",
      "<br>Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?\n",
      "<br>Good man.\n",
      "<br>After that, I worked\n",
      "on a squid boat in Monterey...\n",
      "<br>...then I went to Los Angeles to the...\n",
      "<br>...Santa Monica pier\n",
      "and did portraits for 10 cents each.\n",
      "<br>Why can't I be like you?\n",
      "<br>Just head out for the horizon\n",
      "whenever I feel like it.\n",
      "<br>Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...\n",
      "<br>only if we just talk about it\n",
      "<br>No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.\n",
      "<br>Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up\n",
      "<br>We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.\n",
      "<br>But you have to do it like a real cowboy.\n",
      "No sidesaddle stuff.\n",
      "<br>You mean with one leg on each side?\n",
      "<br>Can you show me?\n",
      "<br>Sure, if you like.\n",
      "<br>Teach me to ride like a man.\n",
      "<br>Chew tobacco like a man.\n",
      "<br>And spit like a man.\n",
      "<br>You didn't learn in finishing school?\n",
      "<br>No.\n",
      "<br>Come on, I'll show you.\n",
      "<br>I'll show you how.\n",
      "<br>Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.\n",
      "<br>I couldn't possibly, Jack.\n",
      "<br>Watch closely.\n",
      "<br>That's disgusting.\n",
      "<br>Your turn\n",
      "<br>That was pitiful.\n",
      "You really have to hawk it back.\n",
      "<br>Get some leverage.\n",
      "Use your arms. Arc your neck.\n",
      "<br>You see the range on that thing?\n",
      "<br>Okay, go.\n",
      "<br>That was better. You have to work on it.\n",
      "Really try to hawk it up.\n",
      "<br>Mother.\n",
      "<br>May I introduce Jack Dawson?\n",
      "<br>Charmed, I'm sure.\n",
      "<br>The others were gracious and curious\n",
      "about the man who'd saved my life.\n",
      "<br>But my mother looked at him like an insect.\n",
      "<br>A dangerous insect\n",
      "which must be squashed quickly.\n",
      "<br>Sounds like you're a good man\n",
      "to have around in a sticky spot.\n",
      "<br>Why do they always insist on announcing\n",
      "dinner like a damn cavalry charge?\n",
      "<br>Shall we go dress, Mother?\n",
      "<br>See you at dinner, Jack.\n",
      "<br>Uh, son?\n",
      "<br>Son!\n",
      "<br>Do you have any idea what you're doing?\n",
      "<br>Not really.\n",
      "<br>You're about to go into the snake pit.\n",
      "<br>What are you going to wear?\n",
      "<br>I figured. Come on.\n",
      "<br>I was right. You and my son\n",
      "are just about the same size.\n",
      "<br>Pretty close.\n",
      "<br>You shine up like a new penny.\n",
      "<br>Good evening, sir.\n",
      "<br>Thousands of tons of Hockley steel\n",
      "are in this ship.\n",
      "<br>- Which part?\n",

      "<br>She'll be along.\n",
      "<br>There is the Countess.\n",
      "<br>I saw that in a nickelodeon\n",
      "and always wanted to do it.\n",
      "<br>Darling...\n",

      "<br>It's amazing.\n",
      "You could almost pass for a gentleman.\n",

      "<br>No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.\n",
      "<br>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br>He must have been nervous,\n",
      "but he never faltered.\n",
      "<br>They assumed he was one of them.\n",
      "<br>Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.\n",
      "<br>New money, obviously,\n",
      "but still a member of the club.\n",
      "<br>Mother, of course,\n",
      "could always be counted upon.\n",
      "<br>Tell us of the accommodations in steerage\n",
      "Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good-\n",
      "<br>The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.\n",
      "<br>Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.\n",
      "<br>He was of help to my fiancée last night.\n",
      "<br>It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.\n",
      "<br>He showed me some of his work today.\n",
      "<br>Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.\n",
      "Not to impugn your work, sir.\n",
      "<br>Are all these mine?\n",
      "<br>Start from the outside and work in.\n",
      "<br>He knows every rivet in her.\n",
      "<br>Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br>Thank you, Rose.\n",
      "<br>How do you take your caviar, sir?\n",
      "<br>No caviar for me, thanks.\n",
      "Never did like it much.\n",
      "<br>Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?\n",
      "<br>Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.\n",
      "<br>After that, I'm on God's good humor.\n",
      "<br>How do you have means to travel?\n",
      "<br>I work my way from place to place.\n",
      "Tramp steamers and such.\n",
      "<br>I won my ticket on Titanic\n",
      "at a lucky hand at poker.\n",
      "<br>A very lucky hand.\n",
      "<br>All life is a game of luck.\n",
      "<br>A real man makes his own luck.\n",
      "Right, Dawson?\n",
      "<br>And you find\n",
      "that sort of rootless existence appealing?\n",
      "<br>Yes, ma'am, I do.\n",
      "<br>I've got everything I need\n",
      "right here with me.\n",
      "<br>I have air in my lungs\n",
      "and blank sheets of paper.\n",
      "<br>I love waking up, not knowing\n",
      "what will happen or who I'll meet.\n",
      "<br>Where I'll wind up.\n",
      "<br>One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...\n",
      "<br>...now I'm on the grandest ship\n",
      "in the world, with you fine people.\n",
      "<br>I'll take more of that.\n",
      "<br>Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.\n",
      "<br>You never know what hand you'll get dealt.\n",
      "<br>You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.\n",
      "<br>Make each day count.\n",
      "<br>Well said, Jack.\n",
      "<br>Hear, hear.\n",
      "<br>To making it count.\n",
      "<br>To making it count.\n",
      "<br>Bravo.\n",
      "<br>But Mr. Brown didn't know\n",
      "I'd hidden the money in the stove.\n",
      "<br>He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating\n",
      "and lights a fire.\n",
      "<br>Next is brandy in the smoking room.\n",
      "<br>Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?\n",
      "<br>Now they retreat to congratulate each\n",
      "other on being masters of the universe.\n",
      "<br>Ladies, thank you for your company.\n",
      "<br>May I escort you to the cabin?\n",
      "<br>No, I'll stay here.\n",
      "<br>Here, Molly.\n",
      "<br>Joining us, Dawson?\n",
      "<br>You don't want to stay with the women.\n",
      "<br>No, thanks. I have to head back.\n",
      "<br>That's best. It'll be all business and politics.\n",
      "Wouldn't interest you.\n",
      "<br>But Dawson, good of you to come.\n",
      "<br>Must you go?\n",
      "<br>Time for me to row with the other slaves.\n",
      "<br>Good night, Rose.\n",
      "<br>Want to go to a real party?\n",
      "<br>Is okay I put my hand here?\n",
      "<br>I can't understand you.\n",
      "<br>I'm going to dance with her now.\n",
      "<br>Come on.\n",
      "<br>Come on. Come with me.\n",
      "<br>Jack. Jack, wait.\n",
      "<br>I can't do this.\n",
      "<br>We'll have to get a bit closer.\n",
      "<br>Like this.\n",
      "<br>You're still my best girl, Cora.\n",
      "<br>- I don't know the steps.\n",
      "- Me, either. Just go with it.\n",
      "<br>Don't think.\n",
      "<br>Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!\n",
      "<br>Wh at? Wait!\n",
      "<br>Jack, no.\n",
      "<br>--Beyond the jurisdiction\n",
      "of the Sherman Act.\n",
      "<br>That's what Rockefeller said--\n",
      "Supreme Court didn't swallow it.\n",
      "<br>What? You think\n",
      "a first-class girl can't drink?\n",
      "<br>Get out of here.\n",
      "<br>Are you all right?\n",
      "<br>I'm fine.\n",
      "<br>Two out of three.\n",
      "<br>So...\n",
      "<br>...you think you're tough?\n",
      "<br>Let's see you do this.\n",
      "<br>Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.\n",
      "<br>Jesus!\n",
      "<br>You okay?\n",
      "<br>I haven't done that in years.\n",
      "<br>Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go.\n",
      "<br>Coffee, sir?\n",
      "<br>You didn't come to me last night.\n",
      "<br>I was tired.\n",
      "<br>Your exertions below deck\n",
      "were no doubt exhausting.\n",
      "<br>I see you had\n",
      "that undertaker of a manservant follow me.\n",
      "<br>You will never behave like that again.\n",
      "<br>I'm not one of your mill foremen\n",
      "who you can command.\n",
      "<br>I'm your fiancée.\n",
      "<br>My fiancée. My fiancée!\n",
      "<br>Yes, you are! And my wife!\n",
      "<br>My wife in practice,\n",
      "if not yet by law, so you will honor me!\n",
      "<br>You will honor me the way\n",
      "a wife honors her husband.\n",
      "<br>Because I will not be made a fool of.\n",
      "<br>Is this in any way unclear?\n",
      "<br>No.\n",
      "<br>Good. Excuse me.\n",
      "<br>Oh, Miss Rose.\n",
      "<br>We had a little accident.\n",
      "<br>- That's all right.\n",
      "- I'm sorry.\n",
      "<br>Let me help you.\n",
      "<br>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br>Tea, Trudy.\n",
      "<br>You're not to see that boy again.\n",
      "You understand?\n",
      "<br>Rose, I forbid it.\n",
      "<br>Stop it, Mother.\n",
      "You'll give yourself a nosebleed.\n",
      "<br>This is not a game.\n",
      "<br>Our situation is precarious.\n",
      "You know the money's gone.\n",
      "<br>Of course I know.\n",
      "You remind me every day.\n",
      "<br>Your father left us nothing but a legacy\n",
      "of bad debts hidden by a good name.\n",
      "<br>That name is the only card we have to play.\n",
      "<br>I don't understand you.\n",
      "<br>It is a fine match with Hockley.\n",
      "It will ensure our survival.\n",
      "<br>How can you put this on me?\n",
      "<br>Why are you being so selfish?\n",
      "<br>I'm being selfish?\n",
      "<br>Do you want to see me\n",
      "working as a seamstress?\n",
      "<br>Is that what you want?\n",
      "<br>To see our fine things sold at auction?\n",
      "<br>Our memories scattered?\n",
      "<br>It's so unfair.\n",
      "<br>Of course it's unfair.\n",
      "<br>We're women.\n",
      "<br>Our choices are never easy.\n",
      "<br>Protect them by Thy guiding hand\n",
      "<br>From every peril on the land\n",
      "<br>O, spirit whom the Father sent\n",
      "<br>To spread abroad the firmament\n",
      "<br>O, wind of heaven, by Thy might\n",
      "<br>Save all who dare the eagle 's ﬂight\n",
      "<br>And keep them by Thy watchful care...\n",
      "<br>Hello, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br>I need to talk to someone.\n",
      "<br>You're not supposed to be in here.\n",
      "<br>I was here last night, remember?\n",
      "<br>No. Now please turn around.\n",
      "<br>He'll tell you. I just need to talk--\n",
      "<br>Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...\n",
      "<br>...are still appreciative of your assistance.\n",
      "<br>They asked me\n",
      "to give you this in gratitude--\n",
      "<br>I don't want your money.\n",
      "<br>--And remind you you are\n",
      "in third class and your presence here...\n",
      "<br>...is no longer appropriate.\n",
      "<br>Let me speak to Rose.\n",
      "<br>Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson\n",
      "returns to where he belongs...\n",
      "<br>...and that he stays there?\n",
      "<br>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br>Come along, you.\n",
      "<br>Hear us when we cry to Thee\n",
      "<br>For those in peril on the sea\n",
      "<br>Why are there two steering wheels?\n",
      "<br>We use this one near shore.\n",
      "<br>Excuse me, sir.\n",
      "Another ice warning, from the Noordam.\n",
      "<br>Thank you, Sparks.\n",
      "<br>Not to worry.\n",
      "Quite normal for this time of year.\n",
      "<br>In fact, we're speeding up.\n",
      "I've ordered the last boilers lit.\n",
      "<br>Okay, son, wind it up tight\n",
      "like I showed you. That's right.\n",
      "<br>Okay, now let it go.\n",
      "<br>- It was good, wasn't it?\n",
      "- Quite nice. That's excellent.\n",
      "<br>Mr. Andrews...Forgive me.\n",
      "<br>I did the sum\n",
      "in my head...\n",
      "<br>...and with the number of lifeboats\n",
      "times the capacity you mentioned...\n",
      "<br>Forgive me, but it seems that there are\n",
      "not enough for everyone aboard.\n",
      "<br>About half, actually.\n",
      "<br>Rose, you miss nothing,\n",
      "do you?\n",
      "<br>In fact, I put in these new\n",
      "type davits...\n",
      "<br>...which can take an extra row\n",
      "of boats inside this one.\n",
      "<br>But it was thought,\n",
      "by some...\n",
      "<br>...the deck would look\n",
      "too cluttered.\n",
      "<br>So, I was overruled.\n",
      "<br>It's a waste of deck space\n",
      "as it is on an unsinkable ship.\n",
      "<br>Sleep soundly, young Rose.\n",
      "<br>I have built you a good ship,\n",
      "strong and true.\n",
      "<br>She's all the lifeboat\n",
      "you need.\n",
      "<br>Just keep heading aft. The next\n",
      "stop will be the engine room.\n",
      "<br>Jack, this is impossible.\n",
      "I can't see you.\n",
      "<br>- I need to talk to you.\n",
      "- No, Jack. No.\n",
      "<br>Jack.\n",
      "I'm engaged.\n",
      "<br>I'm marrying Cal.\n",
      "<br>I love Cal.\n",
      "<br>Rose...\n",
      "<br>...you're no picnic. All right?\n",
      "You're a spoiled little brat even.\n",
      "<br>But under that, you're the\n",
      "most amazingly, astounding\n",
      "<br>...wonderful girl...\n",
      "<br>...woman, that I've ever known.\n",
      "<br>Jack, I--\n",
      "<br>No, let me try and get\n",
      "this out. You're ama--\n",
      "<br>I'm not an idiot.\n",
      "I know how the world works.\n",
      "<br>I've got ten bucks\n",
      "in my pocket.\n",
      "<br>I have nothing to offer\n",
      "you and I know that.\n",
      "<br>I understand.\n",
      "<br>But I'm too involved now.\n",
      "<br>You jump, I jump\n",
      "Remember?\n",
      "<br>I can't turn away without\n",
      "knowing you'll be all right.\n",
      "<br>That's all that I want.\n",
      "<br>Well, I'm fine.\n",
      "<br>I'll be fine. Really.\n",
      "<br>Really?\n",
      "<br>I don't think so.\n",
      "<br>They've got you trapped, Rose.\n",
      "<br>And you're gonna die if you\n",
      "don't break free.\n",
      "<br>Maybe not right away...\n",
      "<br>...because you're strong...\n",
      "<br>...but sooner or later that\n",
      "fire that I love about you, Rose...\n",
      "<br>...that fire is gonna\n",
      "burn out.\n",
      "<br>It's not up to you\n",
      "to save me, Jack.\n",
      "<br>You're right.\n",
      "<br>Only you can do that.\n",
      "<br>I'm going back.\n",
      "<br>Leave me alone.\n",
      "<br>Tell Lucile about the disaster\n",
      "you had with the stationers.\n",
      "<br>Well, of course the invitations\n",
      "had to be sent back, twice.\n",
      "<br>Oh, my dear.\n",
      "<br>And the dreadful\n",
      "bridesmaids' gowns.\n",
      "<br>Let me tell you what an\n",
      "odyssey that has been.\n",
      "<br>Rose decided she\n",
      "wanted lavender.\n",
      "<br>She knows I detest the color.\n",
      "<br>So, she did it only to spite me.\n",
      "<br>If only you'd come to\n",
      "me sooner.\n",
      "<br>Ruth saw some of my designs in\n",
      "La Mode Illustrée.\n",
      "<br>They were for the trousseau of the Duchess\n",
      "of Marlborough's youngest daughter.\n",
      "<br>They were quite charming.\n",
      "<br>But, I think you'll agree,\n",
      "my dear, that together...\n",
      "<br>...we've created something\n",
      "of a phoenix from the ashes.\n",
      "<br>Hello, Jack.\n",
      "<br>I changed my mind.\n",
      "<br>They said you might be up here.\n",
      "<br>Give me your hand.\n",
      "<br>Now close your eyes.\n",
      "<br>Go on.\n",
      "<br>Now, step up.\n",
      "<br>Now, hold onto the railing.\n",
      "<br>Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "Don't peek.\n",
      "<br>I'm not.\n",
      "<br>Now, step up onto the rail.\n",
      "<br>Hold on. Hold on.\n",
      "<br>Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "<br>Do you trust me?\n",
      "<br>I trust you.\n",
      "<br>All right...\n",
      "<br>---Open your eyes.\n",
      "<br>I'm flying.\n",
      "<br>Jack.\n",
      "<br>Come, Josephine, in my\n",
      "ﬂying machine. Going up...\n",
      "<br>...she goes. Up she goes.\n",
      "<br>That was the last time\n",
      "Titanic ever saw daylight.\n",
      "<br>We're up to dusk the\n",
      "night of the sinking.\n",
      "<br>6 hours to go.\n",
      "<br>Incredible. There's Smith and\n",
      "he's standing there and...\n",
      "<br>...he's got the iceberg warning\n",
      "in his fucking hand...\n",
      "<br>...excuse me--his hand,\n",
      "and he's ordering more speed.\n",
      "<br>26 years of experience\n",
      "working against him.\n",
      "<br>He figures anything big\n",
      "enough to sink, the ship...\n",
      "<br>...they're gonna see in time to turn.\n",
      "<br>But the ship's too big\n",
      "with too small a rudder.\n",
      "<br>Doesn't corner worth a damn.\n",
      "<br>Everything he knows\n",
      "is wrong.\n",
      "<br>It's quite proper, I assure you.\n",
      "This is the sitting room.\n",
      "<br>- Will this light do?\n",
      "- What?\n",
      "<br>Don't artists need good light?\n",
      "<br>That is true, but I'm not\n",
      "used to working in...\n",
      "<br>...such horrible conditions.\n",
      "<br>Monet!\n",
      "<br>- Do you know his work?\n",
      "- Of course.\n",
      "<br>Look at his use of color here.\n",
      "Isn't he great?\n",
      "<br>I know. It's extraordinary.\n",
      "<br>Cal insists on carting\n",
      "this hideous thing everywhere.\n",
      "<br>Should we be expecting him\n",
      "any time soon?\n",
      "<br>Not as long as the cigars\n",
      "and brandy hold out.\n",
      "<br>That's nice.\n",
      "<br>What is it,\n",
      "a sapphire?\n",
      "<br>A diamond.\n",
      "<br>A very rare diamond.\n",
      "<br>Jack, I want you to draw me\n",
      "like one of your French girls.\n",
      "<br>Wearing this.\n",
      "<br>All right.\n",
      "<br>Wearing only this.\n",
      "<br>The last thing I need is another picture of me\n",
      "looking like a porcelain doll.\n",
      "<br>As a paying customer...\n",
      "<br>...I expect to get\n",
      "what I want.\n",
      "<br>Over on the bed\n",
      "...uh, the couch.\n",
      "<br>Come. Lie down.\n",
      "<br>- Tell me when it looks right.\n",
      "- Keep that.\n",
      "<br>Put your arm back\n",
      "the way it was.\n",
      "<br>Put that other arm up,\n",
      "that hand right by your face there.\n",
      "<br>Right.\n",
      "<br>Now, head down.\n",
      "<br>Eyes to me.\n",
      "Keep them on me.\n",
      "<br>And try to stay still.\n",
      "<br>So serious.\n",
      "<br>I believe you are blushing,\n",
      "Mr. Big Artiste.\n",
      "<br>I can't imagine\n",
      "Monsieur Monet blushing.\n",
      "<br>He does landscapes.\n",
      "<br>- Just relax your face.\n",
      "- Sorry.\n",
      "<br>No laughing.\n",
      "<br>My heart was pounding\n",
      "the whole time.\n",
      "<br>It was the most erotic\n",
      "moment of my life...\n",
      "<br>...up until then, at least.\n",
      "<br>So what happened next?\n",
      "<br>You mean,\n",
      "did we do it?\n",
      "<br>Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.\n",
      "<br>Jack was very professional.\n",
      "<br>Thank you.\n",
      "<br>What are you doing?\n",
      "<br>Will you put this\n",
      "back in the safe for me?\n",
      "<br>Gentlemen, would you excuse me.\n",
      "<br>None of the stewards\n",
      "have seen her.\n",
      "<br>This is absurd.\n",
      "It's a ship.\n",
      "<br>There's only so many\n",
      "places she could be.\n",
      "<br>Lovejoy, find her.\n",
      "<br>- Clear.\n",
      "- Yes.\n",
      "<br>I don't think I've ever\n",
      "seen such a flat calm.\n",
      "<br>Like a mill pond.\n",

      "<br>No, over here!\n",

      "doing down here?\n",
      "<br>You shouldn't be down here.\n",
      "<br>It could be dangerous!\n",

      "<br>Bring that steam down! Bring it down!\n",
      "<br>Shut all the dampers! Shut them!\n",
      "<br>Hold it.\n",
      "<br>Hold it!\n",
      "<br>Now! Engage reversing engine!\n",
      "<br>Why ain't they turning?\n",
      "<br>Is it hard over?!\n",
      "<br>It is, sir. Hard over.\n",
      "<br>Come on, come on, come on. Turn.\n",
      "<br>Yes.\n",
      "<br>It's going to hit!\n",

      "<br>Jesus!\n",

      "<br>Go! Go!\n",
      "<br>Out! Out!\n",
      "<br>Oh, my God.\n",
      "<br>That was a close shave.\n",
      "<br>Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!\n",
      "<br>Note the time. Enter it in the log.\n",
      "<br>What was that, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br>An iceberg, sir.\n",
      "<br>I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close.\n",
      "<br>I tried to port round it, but--\n",
      "<br>- Close the watertight doors.\n",
      "- They're closed, sir.\n",
      "<br>All stop.\n",
      "<br>Have the carpenter sound the ship.\n",
      "<br>Come on, let's get the hell out of here!\n",
      "<br>Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder.\n",
      "<br>Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.\n",
      "<br>That's the shudder you felt.\n",
      "Do you need anything?\n",
      "<br>No, thank you.\n",
      "<br>There's talk of an iceberg.\n",
      "<br>I don't see anything. Do you?\n",
      "<br>If this is where the rats are going, I am, too.\n",
      "<br>- You.\n",
      "- There is no emergency.\n",
      "<br>- There is. I've been robbed.\n",
      "- Get the Master at Arms.\n",
      "<br>Now, you moron!\n",
      "<br>Did I miss the fun?\n",
      "<br>- Did you see what happened?\n",
      "- No- I guess it hit over there-\n",
      "<br>Boiler room six is flooded eight feet\n",
      "and the mail hold is worse.\n",
      "<br>- Can you shore up?\n",
      "- Not unless the pumps get ahead.\n",
      "<br>- Have you seen the mail hold?\n",
      "- It's already underwater.\n",
      "<br>This is bad.\n",
      "<br>We should tell Mother and Cal.\n",
      "<br>I think they're very good, sir.\n",
      "<br>Don't touch anything.\n",
      "I want the room photographed.\n",
      "<br>We've been looking for you, miss.\n",
      "<br>Here we go.\n",
      "<br>Something serious has happened.\n",
      "<br>Yes, it has.\n",
      "<br>Indeed.\n",
      "Two things dear to me have disappeared.\n",
      "<br>Now that one is back,\n",
      "I know where to find the other. Search him.\n",
      "<br>- Take your coat off.\n",
      "- Now what?\n",
      "<br>What are you doing?\n",
      "We're in the middle of an emergency.\n",
      "<br>- Is this it?\n",
      "- That's it.\n",
      "<br>This is horseshit!\n",
      "<br>Don't you believe it.\n",
      "<br>- He couldn't have.\n",
      "- Easy enough for a professional.\n",
      "<br>I was with him the entire time.\n",
      "<br>Perhaps he did it while you were putting\n",
      "your clothes back on, dear.\n",
      "<br>Real slick. They put it in my pocket.\n",
      "<br>- Shut up.\n",
      "- It isn't even your pocket.\n",
      "<br>\"Property of A.L. Ryerson.\"\n",
      "<br>That was reported stolen.\n",
      "<br>I just borrowed it.\n",
      "<br>Oh, we have an honest thief.\n",
      "<br>You know I didn't do this, Rose.\n",
      "<br>Don't believe them. You know it.\n",
      "<br>Let's go, son.\n",
      "<br>You know I didn't do it!\n",
      "<br>There's a good lad. Come on.\n",
      "<br>You know I didn't do it! You know me!\n",
      "<br>This is most unfortunate, Captain.\n",
      "<br>Water fourteen feet above the keel\n",
      "in ten minutes...\n",
      "<br>...in the forepeak,\n",
      "all three holds and boiler room six.\n",
      "<br>That's right.\n",
      "<br>When can we get underway?\n",
      "<br>That's five compartments.\n",
      "<br>She can float with four compartments breached,\n",
      "but not five.\n",
      "<br>Not five. As she goes down,\n",
      "the water will spill...\n",
      "<br>...over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,\n",
      "one to the next...\n",
      "<br>...back and back. There's no stopping it.\n",
      "<br>The pumps.\n",
      "<br>The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.\n",
      "<br>As of now, no matter what we do...\n",
      "<br>...Titanic will founder.\n",
      "<br>But this ship can't sink.\n",
      "<br>She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.\n",
      "<br>And she will.\n",
      "<br>It's a mathematical certainty.\n",
      "<br>How much time?\n",
      "<br>An hour. Two, at most.\n",
      "<br>How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br>Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.\n",
      "<br>Well, I believe you may get your headlines,\n",
      "Mr. lsmay.\n",
      "<br>Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?\n",
      "<br>Look at me when I'm talking to you!\n",
      "<br>- Mr. Hockley?\n",
      "- Not now. We're busy.\n",
      "<br>You've been asked to put on lifebelts\n",
      "and go to the boat deck.\n",
      "<br>I said, not now.\n",
      "<br>I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.\n",
      "Dress warmly.\n",
      "<br>It's quite cold out.\n",
      "<br>May I suggest topcoats and hats?\n",
      "<br>This is ridiculous.\n",
      "<br>Not to worry, miss.\n",
      "I'm sure it's just a precaution.\n",
      "<br>Everybody up! Lifebelts on!\n",
      "<br>What's he on about?\n",
      "<br>- Put your lifebelts on!\n",
      "- What is it?\n",
      "<br>Just put them on.\n",
      "<br>C.O.D.?\n",
      "<br>Sir?\n",
      "<br>That's right, C.O.D. The distress call.\n",
      "That's our position.\n",
      "<br>Tell whoever responds we're going down\n",
      "and need immediate assistance.\n",
      "<br>Blimey.\n",
      "<br>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br>Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!\n",
      "<br>Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft!\n",
      "<br>Release those ties!\n",
      "<br>Roll back that cover! Smartly now!\n",
      "<br>Where are the passengers?\n",
      "<br>They went inside- Too cold and noisy for them\n",
      "<br>You there! Get down here\n",
      "and help with these lines!\n",
      "<br>Care for a drink, sir?\n",
      "<br>Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed up\n",
      "and now we're cooling our heels.\n",
      "<br>Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.\n",
      "<br>Nobody knows what's going on.\n",
      "<br>Just like the damn English--everything by the book.\n",
      "<br>No need for language, Mr. Hockley.\n",
      "<br>Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.\n",
      "I want a cup of tea when I return.\n",
      "<br>Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br>I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.\n",
      "<br>Please tell me the truth.\n",
      "<br>The ship will sink.\n",
      "<br>You're certain?\n",
      "<br>In an hour or so, all this\n",
      "will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.\n",
      "<br>Please, tell only who you must.\n",
      "I don't want to cause a panic.\n",
      "<br>And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.\n",
      "<br>You remember what I told you about the boats?\n",
      "<br>Yes.\n",
      "<br>I understand.\n",
      "<br>Over here, son.\n",
      "<br>Sir, there's a big mob\n",
      "at the Second Class Purser's office.\n",
      "<br>Go on. I'll watch him.\n",
      "<br>Aye. Right.\n",
      "<br>Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.\n",
      "Full steam for them, sir.\n",
      "<br>She's the only one responding?\n",
      "<br>The only one close. They'll be here in four hours.\n",
      "<br>Four hours?!\n",
      "<br>Thank you, Bride.\n",
      "<br>My God.\n",
      "<br>We are swung out and ready, sir.\n",
      "<br>Hadn't we better get the women and children\n",
      "into the boats?\n",
      "<br>Yes.\n",
      "<br>Women and children first, yes.\n",
      "<br>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br>Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!\n",
      "<br>Step this way, please. That's right.\n",
      "<br>Come towards me. Thank you.\n",
      "<br>Good.\n",
      "<br>For the time being,\n",
      "I require only women and children\n",
      "<br>Right here.\n",
      "<br>Like the Captain said,\n",
      "nice and cheery, so there's no panic.\n",
      "<br>\"Wedding Dance.\"\n",
      "<br>Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.\n",
      "<br>Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.\n",
      "<br>Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around.\n",
      "<br>It isn't time to go to the boats yet!\n",
      "<br>Please, stay calm.\n",
      "<br>Make sure you have your lifebelts on.\n",
      "<br>Let women and children through to the front.\n",
      "<br>What are we doing?\n",
      "<br>Waiting. Once first-class people\n",
      "are in the boats...\n",
      "<br>...they'll start with us and we want to be ready.\n",
      "<br>Pushing won't get you out any faster.\n",
      "<br>Go get help.\n",
      "<br>Lower it away, left and right together! Steady.\n",
      "<br>Both sides together! Steady!\n",
      "<br>Steady!\n",
      "<br>Steady!\n",

      "<br>Come on, sister, you heard\n",
      "the man. Into the boat.\n",
      "<br>Any room for a gentleman,\n",
      "gentlemen?\n",
      "<br>Only women at this time, sir.\n",
      "<br>Will the lifeboats be\n",
      "seated according to class?\n",
      "<br>I hope they're not too crowded.\n",

      "<br>Don't you understand?\n",

      "<br>Not the better half.\n",
      "<br>Come on, Ruth,\n",
      "get in the boat.\n",
      "<br>First class seats\n",

      "<p class=\"plot\">84 years later, a 100 year-old woman named Rose DeWitt Bukater tells the story to her granddaughter Lizzy Calvert, Brock Lovett, Lewis Bodine, Bobby Buell and Anatoly Mikailavich on the Keldysh about her life set in April 10th 1912, on a ship called Titanic when young Rose boards the departing ship with the upper-class passengers and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, and her fiancé, Caledon Hockley. Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. And she explains the whole story from departure until the death of Titanic on its first and last voyage April 15th, 1912 at 2:20 in the morning.</p>\n",

      "<br/>We've just got to go through a little\n",

      "<br/>Hang on a second.\n",
      "<br/>- Let me see that.\n",
      "- Ah, we may have something here, guys.\n",
      "<br/>Where's the photograph\n",

      "<br/>We'll call you right back.\n",
      "<br/>I'll be goddamned.\n",
      "<br/>Treasure hunter Brock Lovett\n",
      "is best known for finding Spanish gold...\n",
      "<br/>It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute.\n",

      "the most famous shipwreck of all, the Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>He is with us live via satellite\n",
      "from the research ship Keldysh...\n",
      "<br/>...in the North Atlantic. Hello, Brock.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows\n",
      "the familiar stories of Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>You know, the nobility of the\n",
      "band playing to the very end and all that.\n",
      "<br/>But what I'm interested in are the untold stories.\n",
      "The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>And we're out here using robot\n",
      "technology to go further into the wreck...\n",
      "<br/>...than anybody has ever done before.\n",
      "<br/>Your expedition is at the center\n",
      "of a storm of controversy...\n",
      "<br/>...over salvage rights and even ethics.\n",
      "Many are calling you a graverobber.\n",
      "<br/>Well, nobody ever called the\n",
      "recovery of the artifacts...\n",
      "<br/>What is it?\n",
      "<br/>Turn that up, dear.\n",
      "<br/>I have museum-trained experts\n",
      "sent out here making sure...\n",
      "<br/>---that these relics are preserved\n",
      "and catalogued properly.\n",
      "<br/>Take a look at this drawing\n",
      "that we found just today.\n",
      "<br/>A piece of paper that's been underwater\n",
      "for 84 years.\n",
      "<br/>And my team are able to\n",
      "preserve it intact.\n",
      "<br/>Should this have remained unseen\n",
      "at the bottom of the ocean for eternity...\n",
      "<br/>...when we can see and enjoy it now?\n",
      "<br/>I'll be goddamned.\n",
      "<br/>Brock!\n",
      "<br/>There's a satellite call for you.\n",
      "<br/>Bobby, we're launching. You see\n",
      "these submersibles going in the water?\n",
      "<br/>Trust me, buddy.\n",
      "You want to take this call.\n",
      "<br/>This better be good.\n",
      "<br/>Now, you gotta speak up.\n",
      "She's kind of old.\n",
      "<br/>Great.\n",
      "<br/>This is Brock Lovett.\n",
      "How can I help you, Mrs...?\n",
      "<br/>Calvert. Rose Calvert.\n",
      "<br/>Mrs. Calvert.\n",
      "<br/>I was just wondering if you had found...\n",
      "<br/>...the \"Heart of the Ocean\" yet, Mr. Lovett.\n",
      "<br/>Told you you wanted to take the call.\n",
      "<br/>All right, you have my\n",
      "attention, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Can you tell us who the woman\n",
      "in the picture is?\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.\n",
      "<br/>She's a goddamn liar!\n",
      "Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.\n",
      "<br/>God only knows why.\n",
      "Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.\n",
      "<br/>They're inbound!\n",
      "<br/>Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the\n",
      "Titanic when she was 17, right?\n",
      "<br/>- That's right.\n",
      "- If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.\n",
      "<br/>101 next month.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.\n",
      "<br/>Look, I've already done the\n",
      "background on this woman...\n",
      "<br/>...all the way back to the 20s,\n",
      "when she was working as an actress.\n",
      "<br/>An actress.\n",
      "There's your first clue, Sherlock.\n",
      "<br/>Her name was Rose Dawson back then.\n",
      "Then she marries this guy named Calvert.\n",
      "<br/>They move to Cedar Rapids\n",
      "and she punches out a couple of kids.\n",
      "<br/>Now Calvert's dead\n",
      "and, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.\n",
      "<br/>And everybody who knows about the\n",
      "diamond is supposed to be dead...\n",
      "<br/>...or on this boat,\n",
      "but she knows.\n",
      "<br/>Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?\n",
      "<br/>Hurry up, give him a hand.\n",
      "<br/>Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.\n",
      "Welcome to the Keldysh.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, let's get her inside there.\n",
      "<br/>Hi, Miss Calvert.\n",
      "<br/>- Hi.\n",
      "- Welcome to the Keldysh.\n",
      "<br/>Thanks.\n",
      "<br/>Hey!\n",
      "<br/>Are your staterooms\n",
      "all right?\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br/>Very nice.\n",
      "<br/>Have you met my\n",
      "granddaughter, Lizzy?\n",
      "<br/>She takes care of me.\n",
      "<br/>We met just a few\n",
      "minutes ago.\n",
      "<br/>Remember, Nana?\n",
      "Up on deck?\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br/>There. That's nice.\n",
      "<br/>Have to have my\n",
      "pictures when I travel.\n",
      "<br/>Can I get you anything?\n",
      "<br/>Is there anything you'd like?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I would like to\n",
      "see my drawing.\n",
      "<br/>Louis XVI wore a fabulous\n",
      "stone that was...\n",
      "<br/>...called the Blue Diamond\n",
      "of the Crown...\n",
      "<br/>...which disappeared\n",
      "in 1792...\n",
      "<br/>...about the same time old Louis lost\n",
      "everything from the neck up.\n",
      "<br/>The theory goes that the\n",
      "crown diamond was chopped, too.\n",
      "<br/>Recut into a heart-like shape that\n",
      "became known as...\n",
      "<br/>...the Heart of the Ocean.\n",
      "<br/>Today it would be worth\n",
      "more than the Hope diamond.\n",
      "<br/>It was a dreadful,\n",
      "heavy thing.\n",
      "<br/>I only wore it this once.\n",
      "<br/>You actually think\n",
      "this is you, Nana?\n",
      "<br/>It is me, dear.\n",
      "<br/>Wasn't I a dish?\n",
      "<br/>I tracked it down\n",
      "through insurance records.\n",
      "<br/>An old claim that was settled\n",
      "under terms of absolute secrecy.\n",
      "<br/>Can you tell me who the\n",
      "claimant was, Rose?\n",
      "<br/>I should imagine someone\n",
      "named Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Nathan Hockley,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "<br/>Pittsburgh steel tycoon.\n",
      "<br/>The claim was for a\n",
      "diamond necklace his son...\n",
      "<br/>...Caledon, bought his fiancée.\n",
      "<br/>You.\n",
      "<br/>A week before he\n",
      "sailed on Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>And it was filed right\n",
      "after the sinking.\n",
      "<br/>So the diamond had to have\n",
      "gone down with the ship.\n",
      "<br/>You see the date?\n",
      "<br/>April 14, 1912\n",
      "<br/>Which means if your grandmother\n",
      "is who she says she is...\n",
      "<br/>...she was wearing the diamond\n",
      "the day the Titanic sank.\n",
      "<br/>And that makes you\n",
      "my new best friend.\n",
      "<br/>These are some of the things\n",
      "we recovered from your stateroom.\n",
      "<br/>This was mine.\n",
      "<br/>How extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>And it looks the same as it\n",
      "did the last time I saw it.\n",
      "<br/>The reflection has\n",
      "changed a bit.\n",
      "<br/>Are you ready to go\n",
      "back to Titanic?\n",
      "<br/>Okay, here we go.\n",
      "<br/>She hits the berg on\n",
      "the starboard side, right?\n",
      "<br/>She kind of bumps along...\n",
      "<br/>...punching holes like\n",
      "morse code...\n",
      "<br/>-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...\n",
      "<br/>...below the waterline.\n",
      "<br/>Then the forward compartments\n",
      "start to flood.\n",
      "<br/>Now, as the water\n",
      "level rises...\n",
      "<br/>...it spills over the\n",
      "watertight bulkheads...\n",
      "<br/>which, unfortunately, don't go\n",
      "any higher than E deck-\n",
      "<br/>So now as the\n",
      "bow goes down...\n",
      "<br/>...the stern rises up,\n",
      "slow at first...\n",
      "<br/>...then faster and faster...\n",
      "<br/>...until finally, she's got her whole\n",
      "ass sticking up in the air.\n",
      "<br/>And that's a big ass.\n",
      "<br/>We're talking\n",
      "20, 30,000 tons. Okay?\n",
      "<br/>And the hull's not designed\n",
      "to deal with that pressure.\n",
      "<br/>So, what happens?\n",
      "<br/>She splits, right\n",
      "down to the keel.\n",
      "<br/>And the stern...\n",
      "<br/>...falls back level.\n",
      "<br/>Then...\n",
      "<br/>...as the bow sinks...\n",
      "<br/>...it pulls the stern vertical...\n",
      "<br/>...and then finally detaches.\n",
      "<br/>Now the stern section just kind of bobs\n",
      "there like a cork for a couple of minutes...\n",
      "<br/>...floods, and finally goes\n",
      "under about 2:20 AM...\n",
      "<br/>...2 hours and 40 minutes\n",
      "after the collision.\n",
      "<br/>The bow section\n",
      "planes away...\n",
      "<br/>...landing about a\n",
      "half a mile away...\n",
      "<br/>...going 20, 30 knots when\n",
      "it hits the ocean floor.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty cool, huh?\n",
      "<br/>Thank you for that fine\n",
      "forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.\n",
      "<br/>Of course, the\n",
      "experience of it was...\n",
      "<br/>...somewhat different.\n",
      "<br/>Will you share it with us?\n",
      "<br/>I'm taking her to rest.\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, Nana.\n",
      "<br/>No!\n",
      "<br/>Give me the\n",
      "tape recorder.\n",
      "<br/>Tell us, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>It's been 84 years--\n",
      "<br/>It's okay. Just try\n",
      "to remember anything...\n",
      "<br/>...anything at all.\n",
      "<br/>Do you want to hear this\n",
      "or not, Mr. Lovett?\n",
      "<br/>It's been 84 years...\n",
      "<br/>...and I can still smell\n",
      "the fresh paint.\n",
      "<br/>The china had\n",
      "never been used.\n",
      "<br/>The sheets had\n",
      "never been slept in.\n",
      "<br/>Titanic was called\n",
      "the ship of dreams.\n",
      "<br/>And it was.\n",
      "<br/>It really was.\n",

      "<br/>This should be interesting.\n",
      "<br/>Can I bum a smoke?\n",
      "<br/>You'll want to tie those.\n",
      "<br/>It's interesting...\n",
      "<br/>...the young lady slipped\n",
      "so suddenly...\n",
      "<br/>...and you still had time to remove\n",
      "your jacket and your shoes.\n",
      "<br/>I know you've been melancholy.\n",
      "<br/>I don't pretend to know why.\n",
      "<br/>I intended to save this...\n",
      "<br/>...until the engagement\n",
      "gala next week...\n",
      "<br/>...but, I thought...\n",
      "<br/>...tonight.\n",
      "<br/>Good gracious.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps as a reminder\n",
      "of my feelings for you.\n",
      "<br/>- Is it a--\n",
      "- Diamond. Yes.\n",
      "<br/>56 carats to be exact.\n",
      "<br/>It was worn by Louis XVI.\n",
      "<br/>And they called\n",
      "it Le Coeur de Ia Mer.\n",
      "<br/>- The Heart of the Ocean.\n",
      "- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.\n",
      "<br/>It's overwhelming.\n",
      "<br/>Well, it's for royalty.\n",
      "<br/>We are royalty, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>You know, there's\n",
      "nothing I couldn't give you.\n",
      "<br/>There's nothing I'd deny you...\n",
      "<br/>...if you would not deny me.\n",
      "<br/>Open your heart to me, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I've been on my own since\n",
      "I was 15, since my folks died.\n",
      "<br/>And I had no brothers or sisters or\n",
      "close kin in that part of the country...\n",
      "<br/>...so I lit on out of there and I\n",
      "haven't been back since.\n",
      "<br/>You could just call me a\n",
      "tumbleweed blowing in the wind.\n",
      "<br/>Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile\n",
      "around this boat deck and...\n",
      "<br/>...chewed over how great the weather's\n",
      "been and how I grew up...\n",
      "<br/>...but I reckon that's not why\n",
      "you came to talk to me, is it?\n",
      "<br/>- Mr. Dawson, I--\n",
      "- Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Jack.\n",
      "<br/>I want to thank you\n",
      "for what you did.\n",
      "<br/>Not just for pulling me back,\n",
      "but for your discretion.\n",
      "<br/>You're welcome.\n",
      "<br/>Look.\n",
      "<br/>I know what you\n",
      "must be thinking.\n",
      "<br/>Poor little rich girl.\n",
      "<br/>What does she know about misery?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>No, that's not what I was thinking.\n",
      "<br/>What I was thinking was...\n",
      "<br/>---what could have happened to this girl\n",
      "to make her think she had no way out?\n",
      "<br/>Well I...\n",
      "<br/>It was everything.\n",
      "It was my whole world and...\n",
      "<br/>...all the people in it.\n",
      "<br/>And the inertia of my life,\n",
      "plunging ahead and me...\n",
      "<br/>...powerless to stop it.\n",
      "<br/>God,\n",
      "look at that thing.\n",
      "<br/>You would have gone\n",
      "straight to the bottom.\n",
      "<br/>500 invitations have gone out.\n",
      "<br/>All of Philadelphia society will be there.\n",
      "<br/>And all the while I feel I'm...\n",
      "<br/>...standing in the middle\n",
      "of a crowded room...\n",
      "<br/>...screaming at the\n",
      "top of my lungs...\n",
      "<br/>...and no one\n",
      "even looks up.\n",
      "<br/>Do you love him?\n",
      "<br/>Pardon me?\n",
      "<br/>Do you love him?\n",
      "<br/>You're being very rude. You\n",
      "shouldn't be asking me this.\n",
      "<br/>Well, it's a simple question.\n",
      "Do you love the guy or not?\n",
      "<br/>This is not a suitable conversation.\n",
      "<br/>VVhy can't you just\n",
      "answer the question?\n",
      "<br/>This is absurd.\n",
      "<br/>You don't know me\n",
      "and I don't know you...\n",
      "<br/>...and we are not having this\n",
      "conversation at all. You are rude...\n",
      "<br/>...and uncouth and presumptuous\n",
      "and I am leaving now...\n",
      "<br/>...Jack. Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "It's been a pleasure.\n",
      "<br/>I sought you out to thank you\n",
      "and now I have thanked you.\n",
      "<br/>And you've insulted me.\n",
      "<br/>Well, you deserved it.\n",
      "<br/>- Right.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "<br/>I thought you were leaving.\n",
      "<br/>I am.\n",
      "<br/>You are so annoying.\n",
      "<br/>Wait.\n",
      "<br/>I don't have to leave. This is\n",
      "my part of the ship. You leave.\n",
      "<br/>Well, well, well.\n",
      "Now who's being rude?\n",
      "<br/>What is this stupid thing\n",
      "you're carrying around?\n",
      "<br/>So, what are you,\n",
      "an artist or something?\n",
      "<br/>These are rather good.\n",
      "<br/>They're very good, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, this is exquisite work.\n",
      "<br/>Ah, they didn't think too\n",
      "much of them in old Paree.\n",
      "<br/>Paris?\n",
      "<br/>You do get around\n",
      "for a p--\n",
      "<br/>Well, a-- a\n",
      "person of limited means.\n",
      "<br/>Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.\n",
      "<br/>Well, well, well.\n",
      "<br/>And these were drawn from life?\n",
      "<br/>Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.\n",
      "<br/>Lots of girls are willing\n",
      "to take their clothes off.\n",
      "<br/>You liked this woman.\n",
      "<br/>You used her several times.\n",
      "<br/>Well.\n",
      "<br/>She had beautiful\n",
      "hands, you see?\n",
      "<br/>I think you must have\n",
      "had a love affair with her.\n",
      "<br/>No, no, no.\n",
      "Just with her hands.\n",
      "<br/>She was a\n",
      "one-legged prostitute.\n",
      "<br/>See?\n",
      "<br/>She had a good\n",
      "sense of humor though.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, and this lady...\n",
      "<br/>She used to sit at this bar every night...\n",
      "<br/>...wearing every piece\n",
      "of jewelry she owned...\n",
      "<br/>...just waiting for\n",
      "her long, lost love.\n",
      "<br/>We called her Madame Bijoux.\n",
      "<br/>See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.\n",
      "<br/>Well,\n",
      "you have a gift, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>You do.\n",
      "<br/>You see people.\n",
      "<br/>I see you.\n",
      "<br/>And?\n",
      "<br/>You wouldn't have jumped.\n",
      "<br/>But the purpose of university\n",
      "is to find a suitable husband.\n",
      "<br/>Rose has already done that.\n",
      "<br/>Look, here comes that\n",
      "vulgar Brown woman.\n",
      "<br/>Quickly, get up before\n",
      "she sits with us.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, girls. I was hoping\n",
      "I'd catch you at tea.\n",
      "<br/>We're awfully sorry,\n",
      "you missed it.\n",
      "<br/>The Countess and I were just\n",
      "off to take the air on the boat deck.\n",
      "<br/>What a lovely idea.\n",
      "I need to catch up on my gossip.\n",
      "<br/>Countess.\n",
      "<br/>So, you've not yet lit the\n",
      "last four boilers?\n",
      "<br/>No, I don't see\n",
      "the need.\n",
      "<br/>We are making excellent time.\n",
      "<br/>The press knows the size of Titanic.\n",
      "Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.\n",
      "<br/>We must give them\n",
      "something new to print.\n",
      "<br/>This maiden voyage\n",
      "of Titanic must...\n",
      "<br/>...make headlines.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. lsmay, I would prefer\n",
      "not to push the engines...\n",
      "<br/>...until they've been properly run in.\n",
      "<br/>Of course I'm just a passenger.\n",
      "<br/>I leave it to your good offices\n",
      "to decide what's best.\n",
      "<br/>But what a glorious end to your final crossing...\n",
      "<br/>...if we were to get into New York\n",
      "on Tuesday night...\n",
      "<br/>...and surprise them all.\n",
      "Make the morning papers.\n",
      "<br/>Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?\n",
      "<br/>Good man.\n",
      "<br/>After that, I worked\n",
      "on a squid boat in Monterey...\n",
      "<br/>...then I went to Los Angeles to the...\n",
      "<br/>...Santa Monica pier\n",
      "and did portraits for 10 cents each.\n",
      "<br/>Why can't I be like you?\n",
      "<br/>Just head out for the horizon\n",
      "whenever I feel like it.\n",
      "<br/>Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...\n",
      "<br/>only if we just talk about it\n",
      "<br/>No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.\n",
      "<br/>Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up\n",
      "<br/>We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.\n",
      "<br/>But you have to do it like a real cowboy.\n",
      "No sidesaddle stuff.\n",
      "<br/>You mean with one leg on each side?\n",
      "<br/>Can you show me?\n",
      "<br/>Sure, if you like.\n",
      "<br/>Teach me to ride like a man.\n",
      "<br/>Chew tobacco like a man.\n",
      "<br/>And spit like a man.\n",
      "<br/>You didn't learn in finishing school?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, I'll show you.\n",
      "<br/>I'll show you how.\n",
      "<br/>Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.\n",
      "<br/>I couldn't possibly, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Watch closely.\n",
      "<br/>That's disgusting.\n",
      "<br/>Your turn\n",
      "<br/>That was pitiful.\n",
      "You really have to hawk it back.\n",
      "<br/>Get some leverage.\n",
      "Use your arms. Arc your neck.\n",
      "<br/>You see the range on that thing?\n",
      "<br/>Okay, go.\n",
      "<br/>That was better. You have to work on it.\n",
      "Really try to hawk it up.\n",
      "<br/>Mother.\n",
      "<br/>May I introduce Jack Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>Charmed, I'm sure.\n",
      "<br/>The others were gracious and curious\n",
      "about the man who'd saved my life.\n",
      "<br/>But my mother looked at him like an insect.\n",
      "<br/>A dangerous insect\n",
      "which must be squashed quickly.\n",
      "<br/>Sounds like you're a good man\n",
      "to have around in a sticky spot.\n",
      "<br/>Why do they always insist on announcing\n",
      "dinner like a damn cavalry charge?\n",
      "<br/>Shall we go dress, Mother?\n",
      "<br/>See you at dinner, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Uh, son?\n",
      "<br/>Son!\n",
      "<br/>Do you have any idea what you're doing?\n",
      "<br/>Not really.\n",
      "<br/>You're about to go into the snake pit.\n",
      "<br/>What are you going to wear?\n",
      "<br/>I figured. Come on.\n",
      "<br/>I was right. You and my son\n",
      "are just about the same size.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty close.\n",
      "<br/>You shine up like a new penny.\n",
      "<br/>Good evening, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Thousands of tons of Hockley steel\n",
      "are in this ship.\n",
      "<br/>- Which part?\n",
      "- All the right ones.\n",
      "<br/>Then you're accountable\n",
      "if there's a problem. Where's Rose?\n",
      "<br/>She'll be along.\n",
      "<br/>There is the Countess.\n",
      "<br/>I saw that in a nickelodeon\n",
      "and always wanted to do it.\n",
      "<br/>Darling...\n",
      "<br/>...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "<br/>It's amazing.\n",
      "You could almost pass for a gentleman.\n",
      "<br/>Almost.\n",
      "<br/>This is extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>This is a remarkable voyage.\n",
      "<br/>- Mad.\n",
      "- Completely lunatic.\n",
      "<br/>There's the Countess of Rothes.\n",
      "<br/>That's John Jacob Astor...\n",
      "<br/>...the richest man on board.\n",
      "<br/>His little wifey, Madeleine,\n",
      "is my age and in a delicate condition.\n",
      "<br/>See how she tries to hide it.\n",
      "<br/>Quite the scandal.\n",
      "<br/>Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,\n",
      "Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...\n",
      "<br/>...is at home with the children, of course.\n",
      "And over here...\n",
      "<br/>...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.\n",
      "<br/>She designs naughty lingerie,\n",
      "among her many talents.\n",
      "<br/>Very popular with the royals.\n",
      "<br/>Congratulations. She's splendid.\n",
      "<br/>Why, thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Escort a lady to dinner?\n",
      "<br/>Certainly.\n",
      "<br/>Sweet pea, sweet pea.\n",
      "<br/>Ain't nothing to it.\n",
      "<br/>They love money. Pretend like you own\n",
      "a gold mine and you're in the club.\n",
      "<br/>Hey, Astor.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.\n",
      "<br/>J.J., Madeleine,\n",
      "I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.\n",
      "<br/>Well, Jack...\n",
      "<br/>...are you of the Boston Dawsons?\n",
      "<br/>No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br/>He must have been nervous,\n",
      "but he never faltered.\n",
      "<br/>They assumed he was one of them.\n",
      "<br/>Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.\n",
      "<br/>New money, obviously,\n",
      "but still a member of the club.\n",
      "<br/>Mother, of course,\n",
      "could always be counted upon.\n",
      "<br/>Tell us of the accommodations in steerage\n",
      "Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good-\n",
      "<br/>The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.\n",
      "<br/>He was of help to my fiancée last night.\n",
      "<br/>It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.\n",
      "<br/>He showed me some of his work today.\n",
      "<br/>Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.\n",
      "Not to impugn your work, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Are all these mine?\n",
      "<br/>Start from the outside and work in.\n",
      "<br/>He knows every rivet in her.\n",
      "<br/>Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>How do you take your caviar, sir?\n",
      "<br/>No caviar for me, thanks.\n",
      "Never did like it much.\n",
      "<br/>Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>After that, I'm on God's good humor.\n",
      "<br/>How do you have means to travel?\n",
      "<br/>I work my way from place to place.\n",
      "Tramp steamers and such.\n",
      "<br/>I won my ticket on Titanic\n",
      "at a lucky hand at poker.\n",
      "<br/>A very lucky hand.\n",
      "<br/>All life is a game of luck.\n",
      "<br/>A real man makes his own luck.\n",
      "Right, Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>And you find\n",
      "that sort of rootless existence appealing?\n",
      "<br/>Yes, ma'am, I do.\n",
      "<br/>I've got everything I need\n",
      "right here with me.\n",
      "<br/>I have air in my lungs\n",
      "and blank sheets of paper.\n",
      "<br/>I love waking up, not knowing\n",
      "what will happen or who I'll meet.\n",
      "<br/>Where I'll wind up.\n",
      "<br/>One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...\n",
      "<br/>...now I'm on the grandest ship\n",
      "in the world, with you fine people.\n",
      "<br/>I'll take more of that.\n",
      "<br/>Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.\n",
      "<br/>You never know what hand you'll get dealt.\n",
      "<br/>You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.\n",
      "<br/>Make each day count.\n",
      "<br/>Well said, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Hear, hear.\n",
      "<br/>To making it count.\n",
      "<br/>To making it count.\n",
      "<br/>Bravo.\n",
      "<br/>But Mr. Brown didn't know\n",
      "I'd hidden the money in the stove.\n",
      "<br/>He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating\n",
      "and lights a fire.\n",
      "<br/>Next is brandy in the smoking room.\n",
      "<br/>Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?\n",
      "<br/>Now they retreat to congratulate each\n",
      "other on being masters of the universe.\n",
      "<br/>Ladies, thank you for your company.\n",
      "<br/>May I escort you to the cabin?\n",
      "<br/>No, I'll stay here.\n",
      "<br/>Here, Molly.\n",
      "<br/>Joining us, Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>You don't want to stay with the women.\n",
      "<br/>No, thanks. I have to head back.\n",
      "<br/>That's best. It'll be all business and politics.\n",
      "Wouldn't interest you.\n",
      "<br/>But Dawson, good of you to come.\n",
      "<br/>Must you go?\n",
      "<br/>Time for me to row with the other slaves.\n",
      "<br/>Good night, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Want to go to a real party?\n",
      "<br/>Is okay I put my hand here?\n",
      "<br/>I can't understand you.\n",
      "<br/>I'm going to dance with her now.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>Come on. Come with me.\n",
      "<br/>Jack. Jack, wait.\n",
      "<br/>I can't do this.\n",
      "<br/>We'll have to get a bit closer.\n",
      "<br/>Like this.\n",
      "<br/>You're still my best girl, Cora.\n",
      "<br/>- I don't know the steps.\n",
      "- Me, either. Just go with it.\n",
      "<br/>Don't think.\n",
      "<br/>Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!\n",
      "<br/>Wh at? Wait!\n",
      "<br/>Jack, no.\n",
      "<br/>--Beyond the jurisdiction\n",
      "of the Sherman Act.\n",
      "<br/>That's what Rockefeller said--\n",
      "Supreme Court didn't swallow it.\n",
      "<br/>What? You think\n",
      "a first-class girl can't drink?\n",
      "<br/>Get out of here.\n",
      "<br/>Are you all right?\n",
      "<br/>I'm fine.\n",
      "<br/>Two out of three.\n",
      "<br/>So...\n",
      "<br/>...you think you're tough?\n",
      "<br/>Let's see you do this.\n",
      "<br/>Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.\n",
      "<br/>Jesus!\n",
      "<br/>You okay?\n",
      "<br/>I haven't done that in years.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go.\n",
      "<br/>Coffee, sir?\n",
      "<br/>You didn't come to me last night.\n",
      "<br/>I was tired.\n",
      "<br/>Your exertions below deck\n",
      "were no doubt exhausting.\n",
      "<br/>I see you had\n",
      "that undertaker of a manservant follow me.\n",
      "<br/>You will never behave like that again.\n",
      "<br/>I'm not one of your mill foremen\n",
      "who you can command.\n",
      "<br/>I'm your fiancée.\n",
      "<br/>My fiancée. My fiancée!\n",
      "<br/>Yes, you are! And my wife!\n",
      "<br/>My wife in practice,\n",
      "if not yet by law, so you will honor me!\n",
      "<br/>You will honor me the way\n",
      "a wife honors her husband.\n",
      "<br/>Because I will not be made a fool of.\n",
      "<br/>Is this in any way unclear?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Good. Excuse me.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, Miss Rose.\n",
      "<br/>We had a little accident.\n",
      "<br/>- That's all right.\n",
      "- I'm sorry.\n",
      "<br/>Let me help you.\n",
      "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br/>Tea, Trudy.\n",
      "<br/>You're not to see that boy again.\n",
      "You understand?\n",
      "<br/>Rose, I forbid it.\n",
      "<br/>Stop it, Mother.\n",
      "You'll give yourself a nosebleed.\n",
      "<br/>This is not a game.\n",
      "<br/>Our situation is precarious.\n",
      "You know the money's gone.\n",
      "<br/>Of course I know.\n",
      "You remind me every day.\n",
      "<br/>Your father left us nothing but a legacy\n",
      "of bad debts hidden by a good name.\n",
      "<br/>That name is the only card we have to play.\n",
      "<br/>I don't understand you.\n",
      "<br/>It is a fine match with Hockley.\n",
      "It will ensure our survival.\n",
      "<br/>How can you put this on me?\n",
      "<br/>Why are you being so selfish?\n",
      "<br/>I'm being selfish?\n",
      "<br/>Do you want to see me\n",
      "working as a seamstress?\n",
      "<br/>Is that what you want?\n",
      "<br/>To see our fine things sold at auction?\n",
      "<br/>Our memories scattered?\n",
      "<br/>It's so unfair.\n",
      "<br/>Of course it's unfair.\n",
      "<br/>We're women.\n",
      "<br/>Our choices are never easy.\n",
      "<br/>Protect them by Thy guiding hand\n",
      "<br/>From every peril on the land\n",
      "<br/>O, spirit whom the Father sent\n",
      "<br/>To spread abroad the firmament\n",
      "<br/>O, wind of heaven, by Thy might\n",
      "<br/>Save all who dare the eagle 's ﬂight\n",
      "<br/>And keep them by Thy watchful care...\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>I need to talk to someone.\n",
      "<br/>You're not supposed to be in here.\n",
      "<br/>I was here last night, remember?\n",
      "<br/>No. Now please turn around.\n",
      "<br/>He'll tell you. I just need to talk--\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...\n",
      "<br/>...are still appreciative of your assistance.\n",
      "<br/>They asked me\n",
      "to give you this in gratitude--\n",
      "<br/>I don't want your money.\n",
      "<br/>--And remind you you are\n",
      "in third class and your presence here...\n",
      "<br/>...is no longer appropriate.\n",
      "<br/>Let me speak to Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson\n",
      "returns to where he belongs...\n",
      "<br/>...and that he stays there?\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Come along, you.\n",
      "<br/>Hear us when we cry to Thee\n",
      "<br/>For those in peril on the sea\n",
      "<br/>Why are there two steering wheels?\n",
      "<br/>We use this one near shore.\n",
      "<br/>Excuse me, sir.\n",
      "Another ice warning, from the Noordam.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Sparks.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry.\n",
      "Quite normal for this time of year.\n",
      "<br/>In fact, we're speeding up.\n",
      "I've ordered the last boilers lit.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, son, wind it up tight\n",
      "like I showed you. That's right.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, now let it go.\n",
      "<br/>- It was good, wasn't it?\n",
      "- Quite nice. That's excellent.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Andrews...Forgive me.\n",
      "<br/>I did the sum\n",
      "in my head...\n",
      "<br/>...and with the number of lifeboats\n",
      "times the capacity you mentioned...\n",
      "<br/>Forgive me, but it seems that there are\n",
      "not enough for everyone aboard.\n",
      "<br/>About half, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Rose, you miss nothing,\n",
      "do you?\n",
      "<br/>In fact, I put in these new\n",
      "type davits...\n",
      "<br/>...which can take an extra row\n",
      "of boats inside this one.\n",
      "<br/>But it was thought,\n",
      "by some...\n",
      "<br/>...the deck would look\n",
      "too cluttered.\n",
      "<br/>So, I was overruled.\n",
      "<br/>It's a waste of deck space\n",
      "as it is on an unsinkable ship.\n",
      "<br/>Sleep soundly, young Rose.\n",
      "<br/>I have built you a good ship,\n",
      "strong and true.\n",
      "<br/>She's all the lifeboat\n",
      "you need.\n",
      "<br/>Just keep heading aft. The next\n",
      "stop will be the engine room.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, this is impossible.\n",
      "I can't see you.\n",
      "<br/>- I need to talk to you.\n",
      "- No, Jack. No.\n",
      "<br/>Jack.\n",
      "I'm engaged.\n",
      "<br/>I'm marrying Cal.\n",
      "<br/>I love Cal.\n",
      "<br/>Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...you're no picnic. All right?\n",
      "You're a spoiled little brat even.\n",
      "<br/>But under that, you're the\n",
      "most amazingly, astounding\n",
      "<br/>...wonderful girl...\n",
      "<br/>...woman, that I've ever known.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, I--\n",
      "<br/>No, let me try and get\n",
      "this out. You're ama--\n",
      "<br/>I'm not an idiot.\n",
      "I know how the world works.\n",
      "<br/>I've got ten bucks\n",
      "in my pocket.\n",
      "<br/>I have nothing to offer\n",
      "you and I know that.\n",
      "<br/>I understand.\n",
      "<br/>But I'm too involved now.\n",
      "<br/>You jump, I jump\n",
      "Remember?\n",
      "<br/>I can't turn away without\n",
      "knowing you'll be all right.\n",
      "<br/>That's all that I want.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I'm fine.\n",
      "<br/>I'll be fine. Really.\n",
      "<br/>Really?\n",
      "<br/>I don't think so.\n",
      "<br/>They've got you trapped, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>And you're gonna die if you\n",
      "don't break free.\n",
      "<br/>Maybe not right away...\n",
      "<br/>...because you're strong...\n",
      "<br/>...but sooner or later that\n",
      "fire that I love about you, Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...that fire is gonna\n",
      "burn out.\n",
      "<br/>It's not up to you\n",
      "to save me, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>You're right.\n",
      "<br/>Only you can do that.\n",
      "<br/>I'm going back.\n",
      "<br/>Leave me alone.\n",
      "<br/>Tell Lucile about the disaster\n",
      "you had with the stationers.\n",
      "<br/>Well, of course the invitations\n",
      "had to be sent back, twice.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, my dear.\n",
      "<br/>And the dreadful\n",
      "bridesmaids' gowns.\n",
      "<br/>Let me tell you what an\n",
      "odyssey that has been.\n",
      "<br/>Rose decided she\n",
      "wanted lavender.\n",
      "<br/>She knows I detest the color.\n",
      "<br/>So, she did it only to spite me.\n",
      "<br/>If only you'd come to\n",
      "me sooner.\n",
      "<br/>Ruth saw some of my designs in\n",
      "La Mode Illustrée.\n",
      "<br/>They were for the trousseau of the Duchess\n",
      "of Marlborough's youngest daughter.\n",
      "<br/>They were quite charming.\n",
      "<br/>But, I think you'll agree,\n",
      "my dear, that together...\n",
      "<br/>...we've created something\n",
      "of a phoenix from the ashes.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>I changed my mind.\n",
      "<br/>They said you might be up here.\n",
      "<br/>Give me your hand.\n",
      "<br/>Now close your eyes.\n",
      "<br/>Go on.\n",
      "<br/>Now, step up.\n",
      "<br/>Now, hold onto the railing.\n",
      "<br/>Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "Don't peek.\n",
      "<br/>I'm not.\n",
      "<br/>Now, step up onto the rail.\n",
      "<br/>Hold on. Hold on.\n",
      "<br/>Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "<br/>Do you trust me?\n",
      "<br/>I trust you.\n",
      "<br/>All right...\n",
      "<br/>---Open your eyes.\n",
      "<br/>I'm flying.\n",
      "<br/>Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Come, Josephine, in my\n",
      "ﬂying machine. Going up...\n",
      "<br/>...she goes. Up she goes.\n",
      "<br/>That was the last time\n",
      "Titanic ever saw daylight.\n",
      "<br/>We're up to dusk the\n",
      "night of the sinking.\n",
      "<br/>6 hours to go.\n",
      "<br/>Incredible. There's Smith and\n",
      "he's standing there and...\n",
      "<br/>...he's got the iceberg warning\n",
      "in his fucking hand...\n",
      "<br/>...excuse me--his hand,\n",
      "and he's ordering more speed.\n",
      "<br/>26 years of experience\n",
      "working against him.\n",
      "<br/>He figures anything big\n",
      "enough to sink, the ship...\n",
      "<br/>...they're gonna see in time to turn.\n",
      "<br/>But the ship's too big\n",
      "with too small a rudder.\n",
      "<br/>Doesn't corner worth a damn.\n",
      "<br/>Everything he knows\n",
      "is wrong.\n",
      "<br/>It's quite proper, I assure you.\n",
      "This is the sitting room.\n",
      "<br/>- Will this light do?\n",
      "- What?\n",
      "<br/>Don't artists need good light?\n",
      "<br/>That is true, but I'm not\n",
      "used to working in...\n",
      "<br/>...such horrible conditions.\n",
      "<br/>Monet!\n",
      "<br/>- Do you know his work?\n",
      "- Of course.\n",
      "<br/>Look at his use of color here.\n",
      "Isn't he great?\n",
      "<br/>I know. It's extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>Cal insists on carting\n",
      "this hideous thing everywhere.\n",
      "<br/>Should we be expecting him\n",
      "any time soon?\n",
      "<br/>Not as long as the cigars\n",
      "and brandy hold out.\n",
      "<br/>That's nice.\n",
      "<br/>What is it,\n",
      "a sapphire?\n",
      "<br/>A diamond.\n",
      "<br/>A very rare diamond.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, I want you to draw me\n",
      "like one of your French girls.\n",
      "<br/>Wearing this.\n",
      "<br/>All right.\n",
      "<br/>Wearing only this.\n",
      "<br/>The last thing I need is another picture of me\n",
      "looking like a porcelain doll.\n",
      "<br/>As a paying customer...\n",
      "<br/>...I expect to get\n",
      "what I want.\n",
      "<br/>Over on the bed\n",
      "...uh, the couch.\n",
      "<br/>Come. Lie down.\n",
      "<br/>- Tell me when it looks right.\n",
      "- Keep that.\n",
      "<br/>Put your arm back\n",
      "the way it was.\n",
      "<br/>Put that other arm up,\n",
      "that hand right by your face there.\n",
      "<br/>Right.\n",
      "<br/>Now, head down.\n",
      "<br/>Eyes to me.\n",
      "Keep them on me.\n",
      "<br/>And try to stay still.\n",
      "<br/>So serious.\n",
      "<br/>I believe you are blushing,\n",
      "Mr. Big Artiste.\n",
      "<br/>I can't imagine\n",
      "Monsieur Monet blushing.\n",
      "<br/>He does landscapes.\n",
      "<br/>- Just relax your face.\n",
      "- Sorry.\n",
      "<br/>No laughing.\n",
      "<br/>My heart was pounding\n",
      "the whole time.\n",
      "<br/>It was the most erotic\n",
      "moment of my life...\n",
      "<br/>...up until then, at least.\n",
      "<br/>So what happened next?\n",
      "<br/>You mean,\n",
      "did we do it?\n",
      "<br/>Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.\n",
      "<br/>Jack was very professional.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>What are you doing?\n",
      "<br/>Will you put this\n",
      "back in the safe for me?\n",
      "<br/>Gentlemen, would you excuse me.\n",
      "<br/>None of the stewards\n",
      "have seen her.\n",
      "<br/>This is absurd.\n",
      "It's a ship.\n",
      "<br/>There's only so many\n",
      "places she could be.\n",
      "<br/>Lovejoy, find her.\n",
      "<br/>- Clear.\n",
      "- Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I don't think I've ever\n",
      "seen such a flat calm.\n",
      "<br/>Like a mill pond.\n",
      "<br/>Not a breath of wind.\n",
      "<br/>It will make the bergs\n",
      "harder to see---\n",
      "<br/>...with no breaking\n",
      "water at the base.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I'm off.\n",
      "<br/>Maintain speed and\n",
      "heading, Mr. Lightoller.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>It's getting cold.\n",
      "You look nice.\n",
      "<br/>Miss Rose?\n",
      "<br/>My drawings!\n",
      "<br/>Come on!\n",
      "<br/>Wait, wait, wait!\n",
      "<br/>Wait, wait, wait!\n",
      "<br/>- Go. Go. Down, down.\n",
      "- Take us down, quickly. Quickly!\n",
      "<br/>Bye.\n",
      "<br/>Sorry.\n",
      "<br/>- Keep going.\n",
      "- Thank you, I've got it.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty tough for\n",
      "a valet, this fella.\n",
      "<br/>Seems more like a cop.\n",
      "<br/>I think he was.\n",
      "<br/>- Oh, shit.\n",
      "- Go!\n",
      "<br/>No, over here!\n",
      "<br/>Quick!\n",
      "<br/>Now what?\n",
      "<br/>Wh at?\n",
      "<br/>More coal for number\n",
      "one, mate.\n",
      "<br/>Hold up? What are you two\n",
      "doing down here?\n",
      "<br/>You shouldn't be down here.\n",
      "<br/>It could be dangerous!\n",
      "<br/>Carry on!\n",
      "<br/>Don't mind us. You're\n",
      "doing a great job!\n",
      "<br/>Keep up the good work!\n",
      "<br/>Look at what we have here, huh?\n",
      "<br/>Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Where to, miss?\n",
      "<br/>To the stars.\n",
      "<br/>You nervous?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Put your hands on me, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>It's bloody cold.\n",
      "<br/>You know, I can smell ice, you know.\n",
      "When it's near.\n",
      "<br/>Bollocks!\n",
      "<br/>Well, I can, all right?\n",
      "<br/>Did you ever find those\n",
      "binoculars for the lookouts?\n",
      "<br/>Haven't seen them\n",
      "since Southampton.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I'll be on\n",
      "my rounds.\n",
      "<br/>Cheerio.\n",
      "<br/>You're trembling.\n",
      "<br/>Don't worry.\n",
      "<br/>I'll be all right.\n",
      "<br/>- They ran down there.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "<br/>Anything missing?\n",
      "<br/>I have a better idea.\n",
      "<br/>GOI you!\n",
      "<br/>Did you see those guys' faces?\n",
      "<br/>Did you see them?\n",
      "<br/>When the ship docks...\n",
      "<br/>...I'm getting off with you.\n",
      "<br/>This is crazy.\n",
      "<br/>I know. It doesn't make any sense.\n",
      "<br/>That's why I trust it.\n",
      "<br/>Here, look at this.\n",
      "<br/>Look at that, would you?\n",
      "<br/>They're warmer than we are.\n",
      "<br/>If that's what it takes for us to get warm,\n",
      "I'd rather not.\n",
      "<br/>Bugger me!\n",
      "<br/>Pick up, you bastards!\n",
      "<br/>Is anyone there?!\n",
      "<br/>What do you see?\n",
      "<br/>Iceberg, right ahead!\n",
      "<br/>Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Iceberg ahead!\n",
      "<br/>Hard a' starboard!\n",
      "<br/>Turn! Turn! Srnartly!\n",
      "<br/>Full astern!\n",
      "<br/>Hard over.\n",
      "<br/>Helm's hard over, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Go, lads, go!\n",
      "<br/>Bring that steam down! Bring it down!\n",
      "<br/>Shut all the dampers! Shut them!\n",
      "<br/>Hold it.\n",
      "<br/>Hold it!\n",
      "<br/>Now! Engage reversing engine!\n",
      "<br/>Why ain't they turning?\n",
      "<br/>Is it hard over?!\n",
      "<br/>It is, sir. Hard over.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, come on, come on. Turn.\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>It's going to hit!\n",
      "<br/>Jesus Christ!\n",
      "<br/>Jesus!\n",
      "<br/>Hard to port!\n",
      "<br/>Hard to port!\n",
      "<br/>Get back!\n",
      "<br/>Let's go!\n",
      "<br/>They're closing the doors! Get out!\n",
      "<br/>Get out the door! Go!\n",
      "<br/>Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!\n",
      "<br/>Go! Go!\n",
      "<br/>Out! Out!\n",
      "<br/>Oh, my God.\n",
      "<br/>That was a close shave.\n",
      "<br/>Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!\n",
      "<br/>Note the time. Enter it in the log.\n",
      "<br/>What was that, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br/>An iceberg, sir.\n",
      "<br/>I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close.\n",
      "<br/>I tried to port round it, but--\n",
      "<br/>- Close the watertight doors.\n",
      "- They're closed, sir.\n",
      "<br/>All stop.\n",
      "<br/>Have the carpenter sound the ship.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, let's get the hell out of here!\n",
      "<br/>Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.\n",
      "<br/>That's the shudder you felt.\n",
      "Do you need anything?\n",
      "<br/>No, thank you.\n",
      "<br/>There's talk of an iceberg.\n",
      "<br/>I don't see anything. Do you?\n",
      "<br/>If this is where the rats are going, I am, too.\n",
      "<br/>- You.\n",
      "- There is no emergency.\n",
      "<br/>- There is. I've been robbed.\n",
      "- Get the Master at Arms.\n",
      "<br/>Now, you moron!\n",
      "<br/>Did I miss the fun?\n",
      "<br/>- Did you see what happened?\n",
      "- No- I guess it hit over there-\n",
      "<br/>Boiler room six is flooded eight feet\n",
      "and the mail hold is worse.\n",
      "<br/>- Can you shore up?\n",
      "- Not unless the pumps get ahead.\n",
      "<br/>- Have you seen the mail hold?\n",
      "- It's already underwater.\n",
      "<br/>This is bad.\n",
      "<br/>We should tell Mother and Cal.\n",
      "<br/>I think they're very good, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Don't touch anything.\n",
      "I want the room photographed.\n",
      "<br/>We've been looking for you, miss.\n",
      "<br/>Here we go.\n",
      "<br/>Something serious has happened.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, it has.\n",
      "<br/>Indeed.\n",
      "Two things dear to me have disappeared.\n",
      "<br/>Now that one is back,\n",
      "I know where to find the other. Search him.\n",
      "<br/>- Take your coat off.\n",
      "- Now what?\n",
      "<br/>What are you doing?\n",
      "We're in the middle of an emergency.\n",
      "<br/>- Is this it?\n",
      "- That's it.\n",
      "<br/>This is horseshit!\n",
      "<br/>Don't you believe it.\n",
      "<br/>- He couldn't have.\n",
      "- Easy enough for a professional.\n",
      "<br/>I was with him the entire time.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps he did it while you were putting\n",
      "your clothes back on, dear.\n",
      "<br/>Real slick. They put it in my pocket.\n",
      "<br/>- Shut up.\n",
      "- It isn't even your pocket.\n",
      "<br/>\"Property of A.L. Ryerson.\"\n",
      "<br/>That was reported stolen.\n",
      "<br/>I just borrowed it.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, we have an honest thief.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do this, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Don't believe them. You know it.\n",
      "<br/>Let's go, son.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do it!\n",
      "<br/>There's a good lad. Come on.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do it! You know me!\n",
      "<br/>This is most unfortunate, Captain.\n",
      "<br/>Water fourteen feet above the keel\n",
      "in ten minutes...\n",
      "<br/>...in the forepeak,\n",
      "all three holds and boiler room six.\n",
      "<br/>That's right.\n",
      "<br/>When can we get underway?\n",
      "<br/>That's five compartments.\n",
      "<br/>She can float with four compartments breached,\n",
      "but not five.\n",
      "<br/>Not five. As she goes down,\n",
      "the water will spill...\n",
      "<br/>...over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,\n",
      "one to the next...\n",
      "<br/>...back and back. There's no stopping it.\n",
      "<br/>The pumps.\n",
      "<br/>The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.\n",
      "<br/>As of now, no matter what we do...\n",
      "<br/>...Titanic will founder.\n",
      "<br/>But this ship can't sink.\n",
      "<br/>She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.\n",
      "<br/>And she will.\n",
      "<br/>It's a mathematical certainty.\n",
      "<br/>How much time?\n",
      "<br/>An hour. Two, at most.\n",
      "<br/>How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br/>Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I believe you may get your headlines,\n",
      "Mr. lsmay.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?\n",
      "<br/>Look at me when I'm talking to you!\n",
      "<br/>- Mr. Hockley?\n",
      "- Not now. We're busy.\n",
      "<br/>You've been asked to put on lifebelts\n",
      "and go to the boat deck.\n",
      "<br/>I said, not now.\n",
      "<br/>I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.\n",
      "Dress warmly.\n",
      "<br/>It's quite cold out.\n",
      "<br/>May I suggest topcoats and hats?\n",
      "<br/>This is ridiculous.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry, miss.\n",
      "I'm sure it's just a precaution.\n",
      "<br/>Everybody up! Lifebelts on!\n",
      "<br/>What's he on about?\n",
      "<br/>- Put your lifebelts on!\n",
      "- What is it?\n",
      "<br/>Just put them on.\n",
      "<br/>C.O.D.?\n",
      "<br/>Sir?\n",
      "<br/>That's right, C.O.D. The distress call.\n",
      "That's our position.\n",
      "<br/>Tell whoever responds we're going down\n",
      "and need immediate assistance.\n",
      "<br/>Blimey.\n",
      "<br/>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br/>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br/>Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!\n",
      "<br/>Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft!\n",
      "<br/>Release those ties!\n",
      "<br/>Roll back that cover! Smartly now!\n",
      "<br/>Where are the passengers?\n",
      "<br/>They went inside- Too cold and noisy for them\n",
      "<br/>You there! Get down here\n",
      "and help with these lines!\n",
      "<br/>Care for a drink, sir?\n",
      "<br/>Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed up\n",
      "and now we're cooling our heels.\n",
      "<br/>Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.\n",
      "<br/>Nobody knows what's going on.\n",
      "<br/>Just like the damn English--everything by the book.\n",
      "<br/>No need for language, Mr. Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.\n",
      "I want a cup of tea when I return.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.\n",
      "<br/>Please tell me the truth.\n",
      "<br/>The ship will sink.\n",
      "<br/>You're certain?\n",
      "<br/>In an hour or so, all this\n",
      "will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.\n",
      "<br/>Please, tell only who you must.\n",
      "I don't want to cause a panic.\n",
      "<br/>And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.\n",
      "<br/>You remember what I told you about the boats?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I understand.\n",
      "<br/>Over here, son.\n",
      "<br/>Sir, there's a big mob\n",
      "at the Second Class Purser's office.\n",
      "<br/>Go on. I'll watch him.\n",
      "<br/>Aye. Right.\n",
      "<br/>Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.\n",
      "Full steam for them, sir.\n",
      "<br/>She's the only one responding?\n",
      "<br/>The only one close. They'll be here in four hours.\n",
      "<br/>Four hours?!\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Bride.\n",
      "<br/>My God.\n",
      "<br/>We are swung out and ready, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Hadn't we better get the women and children\n",
      "into the boats?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>Women and children first, yes.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!\n",
      "<br/>Step this way, please. That's right.\n",
      "<br/>Come towards me. Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Good.\n",
      "<br/>For the time being,\n",
      "I require only women and children\n",
      "<br/>Right here.\n",
      "<br/>Like the Captain said,\n",
      "nice and cheery, so there's no panic.\n",
      "<br/>\"Wedding Dance.\"\n",
      "<br/>Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.\n",
      "<br/>Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.\n",
      "<br/>Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around.\n",
      "<br/>It isn't time to go to the boats yet!\n",
      "<br/>Please, stay calm.\n",
      "<br/>Make sure you have your lifebelts on.\n",
      "<br/>Let women and children through to the front.\n",
      "<br/>What are we doing?\n",
      "<br/>Waiting. Once first-class people\n",
      "are in the boats...\n",
      "<br/>...they'll start with us and we want to be ready.\n",
      "<br/>Pushing won't get you out any faster.\n",
      "<br/>Go get help.\n",
      "<br/>Lower it away, left and right together! Steady.\n",
      "<br/>Both sides together! Steady!\n",
      "<br/>Steady!\n",
      "<br/>Steady!\n",
      "<br/>Stop, stop, stop!\n",

      "<br/>I've been asked to give you\n",
      "this small token of our appreciation.\n",
      "<br/>Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, sister, you heard\n",
      "the man. Into the boat.\n",
      "<br/>Any room for a gentleman,\n",
      "gentlemen?\n",
      "<br/>Only women at this time, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Will the lifeboats be\n",
      "seated according to class?\n",
      "<br/>I hope they're not too crowded.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, Mother, shut up!\n",
      "<br/>Don't you understand?\n",
      "<br/>The water is freezing and\n",

      "<br/>Not enough by half.\n",
      "<br/>Half the people on this\n",

      "<br/>Not the better half.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, Ruth,\n",
      "get in the boat.\n",
      "<br/>First class seats\n",
      "are right up here.\n",

      "keep that drawing.\n",
      "<br/>It'll be worth a lot\n",
      "more by morning.\n",

      "<br/>- Bobby, my cigar.\n",
      "- Right here.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, crack her open.\n",
      "<br/>Shit.\n",
      "<br/>No diamond.\n",
      "<br/>You know boss, this same thing happened\n",
      "to Geraldo and his career never recovered.\n",
      "<br/>Turn the camera off.\n",
      "<br/>Brock, the partners would like\n",
      "to know how it's going.\n",
      "<br/>Hey, Dave, Barry, hi. Look, I it wasn't\n",
      "in the safe. But hey, hey...\n",
      "<br/>...Don't worry about it. There's still\n",
      "plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes.\n",
      "<br/>The floor debris in the suite,\n",
      "the mother's room...\n",
      "<br/>the purser's safe on C deck.\n",
      "<br/>Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.\n",
      "<br/>A dozen other places. Guys, look, you're just\n",
      "going to have to trust my instincts. I know we're close.\n",
      "<br/>We've just got to go through a little\n",
      "process of elimination.\n",
      "<br/>Hang on a second.\n",
      "<br/>- Let me see that.\n",
      "- Ah, we may have something here, guys.\n",
      "<br/>Where's the photograph\n",
      "of the necklace?\n",
      "<br/>We'll call you right back.\n",
      "<br/>I'll be goddamned.\n",
      "<br/>Treasure hunter Brock Lovett\n",
      "is best known for finding Spanish gold...\n",
      "<br/>It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute.\n",
      "<br/>Now he has chartered Russian subs to reach\n",
      "the most famous shipwreck of all, the Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>He is with us live via satellite\n",
      "from the research ship Keldysh...\n",
      "<br/>...in the North Atlantic. Hello, Brock.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows\n",
      "the familiar stories of Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>You know, the nobility of the\n",
      "band playing to the very end and all that.\n",
      "<br/>But what I'm interested in are the untold stories.\n",
      "The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>And we're out here using robot\n",
      "technology to go further into the wreck...\n",
      "<br/>...than anybody has ever done before.\n",
      "<br/>Your expedition is at the center\n",
      "of a storm of controversy...\n",
      "<br/>...over salvage rights and even ethics.\n",
      "Many are calling you a graverobber.\n",
      "<br/>Well, nobody ever called the\n",
      "recovery of the artifacts...\n",
      "<br/>What is it?\n",
      "<br/>Turn that up, dear.\n",
      "<br/>I have museum-trained experts\n",
      "sent out here making sure...\n",
      "<br/>---that these relics are preserved\n",
      "and catalogued properly.\n",
      "<br/>Take a look at this drawing\n",
      "that we found just today.\n",
      "<br/>A piece of paper that's been underwater\n",
      "for 84 years.\n",
      "<br/>And my team are able to\n",
      "preserve it intact.\n",
      "<br/>Should this have remained unseen\n",
      "at the bottom of the ocean for eternity...\n",
      "<br/>...when we can see and enjoy it now?\n",
      "<br/>I'll be goddamned.\n",
      "<br/>Brock!\n",
      "<br/>There's a satellite call for you.\n",
      "<br/>Bobby, we're launching. You see\n",
      "these submersibles going in the water?\n",
      "<br/>Trust me, buddy.\n",
      "You want to take this call.\n",
      "<br/>This better be good.\n",
      "<br/>Now, you gotta speak up.\n",
      "She's kind of old.\n",
      "<br/>Great.\n",
      "<br/>This is Brock Lovett.\n",
      "How can I help you, Mrs...?\n",
      "<br/>Calvert. Rose Calvert.\n",
      "<br/>Mrs. Calvert.\n",
      "<br/>I was just wondering if you had found...\n",
      "<br/>...the \"Heart of the Ocean\" yet, Mr. Lovett.\n",
      "<br/>Told you you wanted to take the call.\n",
      "<br/>All right, you have my\n",
      "attention, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Can you tell us who the woman\n",
      "in the picture is?\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.\n",
      "<br/>She's a goddamn liar!\n",
      "Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.\n",
      "<br/>God only knows why.\n",
      "Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.\n",
      "<br/>They're inbound!\n",
      "<br/>Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the\n",
      "Titanic when she was 17, right?\n",
      "<br/>- That's right.\n",
      "- If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.\n",
      "<br/>101 next month.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.\n",
      "<br/>Look, I've already done the\n",
      "background on this woman...\n",
      "<br/>...all the way back to the 20s,\n",
      "when she was working as an actress.\n",
      "<br/>An actress.\n",
      "There's your first clue, Sherlock.\n",
      "<br/>Her name was Rose Dawson back then.\n",
      "Then she marries this guy named Calvert.\n",
      "<br/>They move to Cedar Rapids\n",
      "and she punches out a couple of kids.\n",
      "<br/>Now Calvert's dead\n",
      "and, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.\n",
      "<br/>And everybody who knows about the\n",
      "diamond is supposed to be dead...\n",
      "<br/>...or on this boat,\n",
      "but she knows.\n",
      "<br/>Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?\n",
      "<br/>Hurry up, give him a hand.\n",
      "<br/>Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.\n",
      "Welcome to the Keldysh.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, let's get her inside there.\n",
      "<br/>Hi, Miss Calvert.\n",
      "<br/>- Hi.\n",
      "- Welcome to the Keldysh.\n",
      "<br/>Thanks.\n",
      "<br/>Hey!\n",
      "<br/>Are your staterooms\n",
      "all right?\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br/>Very nice.\n",
      "<br/>Have you met my\n",
      "granddaughter, Lizzy?\n",
      "<br/>She takes care of me.\n",
      "<br/>We met just a few\n",
      "minutes ago.\n",
      "<br/>Remember, Nana?\n",
      "Up on deck?\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br/>There. That's nice.\n",
      "<br/>Have to have my\n",
      "pictures when I travel.\n",
      "<br/>Can I get you anything?\n",
      "<br/>Is there anything you'd like?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I would like to\n",
      "see my drawing.\n",
      "<br/>Louis XVI wore a fabulous\n",
      "stone that was...\n",
      "<br/>...called the Blue Diamond\n",
      "of the Crown...\n",
      "<br/>...which disappeared\n",
      "in 1792...\n",
      "<br/>...about the same time old Louis lost\n",
      "everything from the neck up.\n",
      "<br/>The theory goes that the\n",
      "crown diamond was chopped, too.\n",
      "<br/>Recut into a heart-like shape that\n",
      "became known as...\n",
      "<br/>...the Heart of the Ocean.\n",
      "<br/>Today it would be worth\n",
      "more than the Hope diamond.\n",
      "<br/>It was a dreadful,\n",
      "heavy thing.\n",
      "<br/>I only wore it this once.\n",
      "<br/>You actually think\n",
      "this is you, Nana?\n",
      "<br/>It is me, dear.\n",
      "<br/>Wasn't I a dish?\n",
      "<br/>I tracked it down\n",
      "through insurance records.\n",
      "<br/>An old claim that was settled\n",
      "under terms of absolute secrecy.\n",
      "<br/>Can you tell me who the\n",
      "claimant was, Rose?\n",
      "<br/>I should imagine someone\n",
      "named Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Nathan Hockley,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "<br/>Pittsburgh steel tycoon.\n",
      "<br/>The claim was for a\n",
      "diamond necklace his son...\n",
      "<br/>...Caledon, bought his fiancée.\n",
      "<br/>You.\n",
      "<br/>A week before he\n",
      "sailed on Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>And it was filed right\n",
      "after the sinking.\n",
      "<br/>So the diamond had to have\n",
      "gone down with the ship.\n",
      "<br/>You see the date?\n",
      "<br/>April 14, 1912\n",
      "<br/>Which means if your grandmother\n",
      "is who she says she is...\n",
      "<br/>...she was wearing the diamond\n",
      "the day the Titanic sank.\n",
      "<br/>And that makes you\n",
      "my new best friend.\n",
      "<br/>These are some of the things\n",
      "we recovered from your stateroom.\n",
      "<br/>This was mine.\n",
      "<br/>How extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>And it looks the same as it\n",
      "did the last time I saw it.\n",
      "<br/>The reflection has\n",
      "changed a bit.\n",
      "<br/>Are you ready to go\n",
      "back to Titanic?\n",
      "<br/>Okay, here we go.\n",
      "<br/>She hits the berg on\n",
      "the starboard side, right?\n",
      "<br/>She kind of bumps along...\n",
      "<br/>...punching holes like\n",
      "morse code...\n",
      "<br/>-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...\n",
      "<br/>...below the waterline.\n",
      "<br/>Then the forward compartments\n",
      "start to flood.\n",
      "<br/>Now, as the water\n",
      "level rises...\n",
      "<br/>...it spills over the\n",
      "watertight bulkheads...\n",
      "<br/>which, unfortunately, don't go\n",
      "any higher than E deck-\n",
      "<br/>So now as the\n",
      "bow goes down...\n",
      "<br/>...the stern rises up,\n",
      "slow at first...\n",
      "<br/>...then faster and faster...\n",
      "<br/>...until finally, she's got her whole\n",
      "ass sticking up in the air.\n",
      "<br/>And that's a big ass.\n",
      "<br/>We're talking\n",
      "20, 30,000 tons. Okay?\n",
      "<br/>And the hull's not designed\n",
      "to deal with that pressure.\n",
      "<br/>So, what happens?\n",
      "<br/>She splits, right\n",
      "down to the keel.\n",
      "<br/>And the stern...\n",
      "<br/>...falls back level.\n",
      "<br/>Then...\n",
      "<br/>...as the bow sinks...\n",
      "<br/>...it pulls the stern vertical...\n",
      "<br/>...and then finally detaches.\n",
      "<br/>Now the stern section just kind of bobs\n",
      "there like a cork for a couple of minutes...\n",
      "<br/>...floods, and finally goes\n",
      "under about 2:20 AM...\n",
      "<br/>...2 hours and 40 minutes\n",
      "after the collision.\n",
      "<br/>The bow section\n",
      "planes away...\n",
      "<br/>...landing about a\n",
      "half a mile away...\n",
      "<br/>...going 20, 30 knots when\n",
      "it hits the ocean floor.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty cool, huh?\n",
      "<br/>Thank you for that fine\n",
      "forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.\n",
      "<br/>Of course, the\n",
      "experience of it was...\n",
      "<br/>...somewhat different.\n",
      "<br/>Will you share it with us?\n",
      "<br/>I'm taking her to rest.\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, Nana.\n",
      "<br/>No!\n",
      "<br/>Give me the\n",
      "tape recorder.\n",
      "<br/>Tell us, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>It's been 84 years--\n",
      "<br/>It's okay. Just try\n",
      "to remember anything...\n",
      "<br/>...anything at all.\n",
      "<br/>Do you want to hear this\n",
      "or not, Mr. Lovett?\n",
      "<br/>It's been 84 years...\n",
      "<br/>...and I can still smell\n",
      "the fresh paint.\n",
      "<br/>The china had\n",
      "never been used.\n",
      "<br/>The sheets had\n",
      "never been slept in.\n",
      "<br/>Titanic was called\n",
      "the ship of dreams.\n",

      "<br/>It really was.\n",

      "<br/>It's a big boat, huh?\n",
      "<br/>Daddy, it's a ship.\n",
      "<br/>You're right.\n",
      "<br/>I don't see what all\n",
      "the fuss is about.\n",
      "<br/>It doesn't look any bigger\n",
      "than the Mauretania.\n",
      "<br/>You can be blasé\n",
      "about some things, Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...but not about Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>It's over 100 feet longer\n",
      "than Mauretania...\n",
      "<br/>...and far more luxurious.\n",
      "<br/>Your daughter is far too\n",
      "difficult to impress, Ruth.\n",
      "<br/>So this is the ship they\n",
      "say is unsinkable.\n",
      "<br/>It is unsinkable.\n",

      "could not sink this ship--\n",

      "<br/>Her husband had struck gold\n",

      "<br/>...we were steaming west\n",

      "<br/>...that its supremacy\n",

      "Bruce?\n",
      "<br/>Yes, actually.\n",
      "<br/>I wanted to convey sheer size.\n",

      "<br/>Do you know of\n",
      "Dr. Freud, Mr. lsmay?\n",

      "<br/>I do apologize.\n",

      "<br/>Freud? Who is he?\n",
      "Is he a passenger?\n",

      "<br/>Yeah. It's an Irish ship.\n",
      "<br/>Is English, no?\n",
      "<br/>No, it was built\n",

      "<br/>I saw my whole life\n",
      "as if I'd already lived it.\n",
      "<br/>An endless parade\n",
      "of parties and cotillions...\n",
      "<br/>yachts and polo matches.\n",
      "<br/>Always the same narrow people,\n",

      "<br/>I grew up there,\n",
      "near Chippewa Falls.\n",
      "<br/>I remember when I was a kid,\n",

      "<br/>...out on Lake Wissota.\n",
      "<br/>Ice fishing is, you know, where you--\n",

      "<br/>Sorry.\n",
      "<br/>You just seem like, you know,\n",
      "kind of an indoor girl.\n",
      "<br/>Anyway, I...\n",

      "<br/>And I'm telling you...\n",
      "<br/>...water that cold,\n",
      "<br/>like right down there...\n",
      "<br/>...it hits you like 1000 knives\n",
      "stabbing you all over your body.\n",

      "<br/>Like I said, women and\n",

      "<br/>Was that the way of it?\n",
      "<br/>Yeah. Yeah, that\n",
      "was pretty much it.\n",
      "<br/>Well, the boy's a hero then.\n",
      "<br/>Good for you, son.\n",
      "Well done.\n",
      "<br/>So, it's all's well and back\n",
      "to our brandy, eh?\n",
      "<br/>Look at you. You must be freezing.\n",
      "Let's get you inside.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps a little something\n",
      "for the boy?\n",
      "<br/>Of course.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Lovejoy,\n",
      "I think a 20 should do it.\n",

      "<br/>Rose is displeased.\n",
      "<br/>What to do?\n",
      "<br/>I know.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps you could join us for\n",

      "<br/>...to regale our group...\n",
      "<br/>...with your heroic tale.\n",
      "<br/>Sure.\n",

      "<br/>...and you still had time to remove\n",
      "your jacket and your shoes.\n",
      "<br/>I know you've been melancholy.\n",
      "<br/>I don't pretend to know why.\n",
      "<br/>I intended to save this...\n",

      "<br/>...but, I thought...\n",
      "<br/>...tonight.\n",
      "<br/>Good gracious.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps as a reminder\n",
      "of my feelings for you.\n",
      "<br/>- Is it a--\n",
      "- Diamond. Yes.\n",
      "<br/>56 carats to be exact.\n",
      "<br/>It was worn by Louis XVI.\n",
      "<br/>And they called\n",
      "it Le Coeur de Ia Mer.\n",

      "- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.\n",
      "<br/>It's overwhelming.\n",
      "<br/>Well, it's for royalty.\n",
      "<br/>We are royalty, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>You know, there's\n",

      "<br/>Well, I've been on my own since\n",
      "I was 15, since my folks died.\n",
      "<br/>And I had no brothers or sisters or\n",
      "close kin in that part of the country...\n",
      "<br/>...so I lit on out of there and I\n",
      "haven't been back since.\n",
      "<br/>You could just call me a\n",

      "<br/>Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile\n",
      "around this boat deck and...\n",
      "<br/>...chewed over how great the weather's\n",
      "been and how I grew up...\n",
      "<br/>...but I reckon that's not why\n",

      "to make her think she had no way out?\n",
      "<br/>Well I...\n",
      "<br/>It was everything.\n",
      "It was my whole world and...\n",
      "<br/>...all the people in it.\n",
      "<br/>And the inertia of my life,\n",
      "plunging ahead and me...\n",
      "<br/>...powerless to stop it.\n",
      "<br/>God,\n",
      "look at that thing.\n",
      "<br/>You would have gone\n",

      "top of my lungs...\n",
      "<br/>...and no one\n",

      "<br/>This is not a suitable conversation.\n",
      "<br/>VVhy can't you just\n",
      "answer the question?\n",
      "<br/>This is absurd.\n",
      "<br/>You don't know me\n",
      "and I don't know you...\n",
      "<br/>...and we are not having this\n",
      "conversation at all. You are rude...\n",
      "<br/>...and uncouth and presumptuous\n",

      "<br/>...Jack. Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "It's been a pleasure.\n",
      "<br/>I sought you out to thank you\n",
      "and now I have thanked you.\n",

      "<br/>Well, you deserved it.\n",
      "<br/>- Right.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "<br/>I thought you were leaving.\n",
      "<br/>I am.\n",
      "<br/>You are so annoying.\n",
      "<br/>Wait.\n",
      "<br/>I don't have to leave. This is\n",
      "my part of the ship. You leave.\n",
      "<br/>Well, well, well.\n",
      "Now who's being rude?\n",
      "<br/>What is this stupid thing\n",
      "you're carrying around?\n",
      "<br/>So, what are you,\n",
      "an artist or something?\n",
      "<br/>These are rather good.\n",
      "<br/>They're very good, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, this is exquisite work.\n",
      "<br/>Ah, they didn't think too\n",
      "much of them in old Paree.\n",
      "<br/>Paris?\n",
      "<br/>You do get around\n",
      "for a p--\n",

      "<br/>Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.\n",
      "<br/>Well, well, well.\n",

      "<br/>Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.\n",
      "<br/>Lots of girls are willing\n",

      "<br/>You liked this woman.\n",
      "<br/>You used her several times.\n",
      "<br/>Well.\n",
      "<br/>She had beautiful\n",
      "hands, you see?\n",
      "<br/>I think you must have\n",

      "<br/>...wearing every piece\n",

      "<br/>But the purpose of university\n",
      "is to find a suitable husband.\n",
      "<br/>Rose has already done that.\n",
      "<br/>Look, here comes that\n",
      "vulgar Brown woman.\n",
      "<br/>Quickly, get up before\n",
      "she sits with us.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, girls. I was hoping\n",
      "I'd catch you at tea.\n",
      "<br/>We're awfully sorry,\n",
      "you missed it.\n",
      "<br/>The Countess and I were just\n",
      "off to take the air on the boat deck.\n",
      "<br/>What a lovely idea.\n",
      "I need to catch up on my gossip.\n",
      "<br/>Countess.\n",
      "<br/>So, you've not yet lit the\n",
      "last four boilers?\n",
      "<br/>No, I don't see\n",
      "the need.\n",
      "<br/>We are making excellent time.\n",
      "<br/>The press knows the size of Titanic.\n",
      "Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.\n",
      "<br/>We must give them\n",
      "something new to print.\n",
      "<br/>This maiden voyage\n",
      "of Titanic must...\n",
      "<br/>...make headlines.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. lsmay, I would prefer\n",
      "not to push the engines...\n",
      "<br/>...until they've been properly run in.\n",
      "<br/>Of course I'm just a passenger.\n",
      "<br/>I leave it to your good offices\n",
      "to decide what's best.\n",
      "<br/>But what a glorious end to your final crossing...\n",
      "<br/>...if we were to get into New York\n",
      "on Tuesday night...\n",
      "<br/>...and surprise them all.\n",
      "Make the morning papers.\n",
      "<br/>Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?\n",
      "<br/>Good man.\n",
      "<br/>After that, I worked\n",
      "on a squid boat in Monterey...\n",
      "<br/>...then I went to Los Angeles to the...\n",
      "<br/>...Santa Monica pier\n",
      "and did portraits for 10 cents each.\n",
      "<br/>Why can't I be like you?\n",
      "<br/>Just head out for the horizon\n",
      "whenever I feel like it.\n",
      "<br/>Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...\n",
      "<br/>only if we just talk about it\n",
      "<br/>No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.\n",
      "<br/>Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up\n",
      "<br/>We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.\n",
      "<br/>But you have to do it like a real cowboy.\n",
      "No sidesaddle stuff.\n",
      "<br/>You mean with one leg on each side?\n",
      "<br/>Can you show me?\n",
      "<br/>Sure, if you like.\n",
      "<br/>Teach me to ride like a man.\n",
      "<br/>Chew tobacco like a man.\n",
      "<br/>And spit like a man.\n",
      "<br/>You didn't learn in finishing school?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, I'll show you.\n",
      "<br/>I'll show you how.\n",
      "<br/>Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.\n",
      "<br/>I couldn't possibly, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Watch closely.\n",
      "<br/>That's disgusting.\n",
      "<br/>Your turn\n",
      "<br/>That was pitiful.\n",
      "You really have to hawk it back.\n",
      "<br/>Get some leverage.\n",
      "Use your arms. Arc your neck.\n",
      "<br/>You see the range on that thing?\n",
      "<br/>Okay, go.\n",
      "<br/>That was better. You have to work on it.\n",
      "Really try to hawk it up.\n",
      "<br/>Mother.\n",
      "<br/>May I introduce Jack Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>Charmed, I'm sure.\n",
      "<br/>The others were gracious and curious\n",
      "about the man who'd saved my life.\n",
      "<br/>But my mother looked at him like an insect.\n",
      "<br/>A dangerous insect\n",
      "which must be squashed quickly.\n",
      "<br/>Sounds like you're a good man\n",
      "to have around in a sticky spot.\n",
      "<br/>Why do they always insist on announcing\n",
      "dinner like a damn cavalry charge?\n",
      "<br/>Shall we go dress, Mother?\n",
      "<br/>See you at dinner, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Uh, son?\n",
      "<br/>Son!\n",
      "<br/>Do you have any idea what you're doing?\n",
      "<br/>Not really.\n",
      "<br/>You're about to go into the snake pit.\n",
      "<br/>What are you going to wear?\n",
      "<br/>I figured. Come on.\n",
      "<br/>I was right. You and my son\n",
      "are just about the same size.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty close.\n",
      "<br/>You shine up like a new penny.\n",
      "<br/>Good evening, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Thousands of tons of Hockley steel\n",
      "are in this ship.\n",
      "<br/>- Which part?\n",
      "- All the right ones.\n",
      "<br/>Then you're accountable\n",
      "if there's a problem. Where's Rose?\n",
      "<br/>She'll be along.\n",
      "<br/>There is the Countess.\n",
      "<br/>I saw that in a nickelodeon\n",
      "and always wanted to do it.\n",
      "<br/>Darling...\n",
      "<br/>...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "<br/>It's amazing.\n",
      "You could almost pass for a gentleman.\n",
      "<br/>Almost.\n",
      "<br/>This is extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>This is a remarkable voyage.\n",
      "<br/>- Mad.\n",
      "- Completely lunatic.\n",
      "<br/>There's the Countess of Rothes.\n",
      "<br/>That's John Jacob Astor...\n",
      "<br/>...the richest man on board.\n",
      "<br/>His little wifey, Madeleine,\n",
      "is my age and in a delicate condition.\n",
      "<br/>See how she tries to hide it.\n",
      "<br/>Quite the scandal.\n",
      "<br/>Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,\n",
      "Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...\n",
      "<br/>...is at home with the children, of course.\n",
      "And over here...\n",
      "<br/>...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.\n",
      "<br/>She designs naughty lingerie,\n",
      "among her many talents.\n",
      "<br/>Very popular with the royals.\n",
      "<br/>Congratulations. She's splendid.\n",
      "<br/>Why, thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Escort a lady to dinner?\n",
      "<br/>Certainly.\n",
      "<br/>Sweet pea, sweet pea.\n",
      "<br/>Ain't nothing to it.\n",
      "<br/>They love money. Pretend like you own\n",
      "a gold mine and you're in the club.\n",
      "<br/>Hey, Astor.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.\n",
      "<br/>J.J., Madeleine,\n",
      "I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.\n",
      "<br/>Well, Jack...\n",
      "<br/>...are you of the Boston Dawsons?\n",
      "<br/>No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br/>He must have been nervous,\n",
      "but he never faltered.\n",
      "<br/>They assumed he was one of them.\n",
      "<br/>Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.\n",
      "<br/>New money, obviously,\n",
      "but still a member of the club.\n",
      "<br/>Mother, of course,\n",
      "could always be counted upon.\n",
      "<br/>Tell us of the accommodations in steerage\n",
      "Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good-\n",
      "<br/>The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.\n",
      "<br/>He was of help to my fiancée last night.\n",
      "<br/>It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.\n",
      "<br/>He showed me some of his work today.\n",
      "<br/>Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.\n",
      "Not to impugn your work, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Are all these mine?\n",
      "<br/>Start from the outside and work in.\n",
      "<br/>He knows every rivet in her.\n",
      "<br/>Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>How do you take your caviar, sir?\n",
      "<br/>No caviar for me, thanks.\n",
      "Never did like it much.\n",
      "<br/>Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>After that, I'm on God's good humor.\n",
      "<br/>How do you have means to travel?\n",
      "<br/>I work my way from place to place.\n",
      "Tramp steamers and such.\n",
      "<br/>I won my ticket on Titanic\n",
      "at a lucky hand at poker.\n",
      "<br/>A very lucky hand.\n",
      "<br/>All life is a game of luck.\n",
      "<br/>A real man makes his own luck.\n",
      "Right, Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>And you find\n",
      "that sort of rootless existence appealing?\n",
      "<br/>Yes, ma'am, I do.\n",
      "<br/>I've got everything I need\n",
      "right here with me.\n",
      "<br/>I have air in my lungs\n",
      "and blank sheets of paper.\n",
      "<br/>I love waking up, not knowing\n",
      "what will happen or who I'll meet.\n",
      "<br/>Where I'll wind up.\n",
      "<br/>One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...\n",
      "<br/>...now I'm on the grandest ship\n",
      "in the world, with you fine people.\n",
      "<br/>I'll take more of that.\n",
      "<br/>Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.\n",
      "<br/>You never know what hand you'll get dealt.\n",
      "<br/>You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.\n",
      "<br/>Make each day count.\n",
      "<br/>Well said, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Hear, hear.\n",
      "<br/>To making it count.\n",
      "<br/>To making it count.\n",
      "<br/>Bravo.\n",
      "<br/>But Mr. Brown didn't know\n",
      "I'd hidden the money in the stove.\n",
      "<br/>He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating\n",
      "and lights a fire.\n",
      "<br/>Next is brandy in the smoking room.\n",
      "<br/>Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?\n",
      "<br/>Now they retreat to congratulate each\n",
      "other on being masters of the universe.\n",
      "<br/>Ladies, thank you for your company.\n",
      "<br/>May I escort you to the cabin?\n",
      "<br/>No, I'll stay here.\n",
      "<br/>Here, Molly.\n",
      "<br/>Joining us, Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>You don't want to stay with the women.\n",
      "<br/>No, thanks. I have to head back.\n",
      "<br/>That's best. It'll be all business and politics.\n",
      "Wouldn't interest you.\n",
      "<br/>But Dawson, good of you to come.\n",
      "<br/>Must you go?\n",
      "<br/>Time for me to row with the other slaves.\n",
      "<br/>Good night, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Want to go to a real party?\n",
      "<br/>Is okay I put my hand here?\n",
      "<br/>I can't understand you.\n",
      "<br/>I'm going to dance with her now.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>Come on. Come with me.\n",
      "<br/>Jack. Jack, wait.\n",
      "<br/>I can't do this.\n",
      "<br/>We'll have to get a bit closer.\n",
      "<br/>Like this.\n",
      "<br/>You're still my best girl, Cora.\n",
      "<br/>- I don't know the steps.\n",
      "- Me, either. Just go with it.\n",
      "<br/>Don't think.\n",
      "<br/>Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!\n",
      "<br/>Wh at? Wait!\n",
      "<br/>Jack, no.\n",
      "<br/>--Beyond the jurisdiction\n",
      "of the Sherman Act.\n",
      "<br/>That's what Rockefeller said--\n",
      "Supreme Court didn't swallow it.\n",
      "<br/>What? You think\n",
      "a first-class girl can't drink?\n",
      "<br/>Get out of here.\n",
      "<br/>Are you all right?\n",
      "<br/>I'm fine.\n",
      "<br/>Two out of three.\n",
      "<br/>So...\n",
      "<br/>...you think you're tough?\n",
      "<br/>Let's see you do this.\n",
      "<br/>Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.\n",
      "<br/>Jesus!\n",
      "<br/>You okay?\n",
      "<br/>I haven't done that in years.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go.\n",
      "<br/>Coffee, sir?\n",
      "<br/>You didn't come to me last night.\n",
      "<br/>I was tired.\n",
      "<br/>Your exertions below deck\n",
      "were no doubt exhausting.\n",
      "<br/>I see you had\n",
      "that undertaker of a manservant follow me.\n",
      "<br/>You will never behave like that again.\n",
      "<br/>I'm not one of your mill foremen\n",
      "who you can command.\n",
      "<br/>I'm your fiancée.\n",
      "<br/>My fiancée. My fiancée!\n",
      "<br/>Yes, you are! And my wife!\n",
      "<br/>My wife in practice,\n",
      "if not yet by law, so you will honor me!\n",
      "<br/>You will honor me the way\n",
      "a wife honors her husband.\n",
      "<br/>Because I will not be made a fool of.\n",
      "<br/>Is this in any way unclear?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Good. Excuse me.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, Miss Rose.\n",
      "<br/>We had a little accident.\n",
      "<br/>- That's all right.\n",
      "- I'm sorry.\n",
      "<br/>Let me help you.\n",
      "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br/>Tea, Trudy.\n",
      "<br/>You're not to see that boy again.\n",
      "You understand?\n",
      "<br/>Rose, I forbid it.\n",
      "<br/>Stop it, Mother.\n",
      "You'll give yourself a nosebleed.\n",
      "<br/>This is not a game.\n",
      "<br/>Our situation is precarious.\n",
      "You know the money's gone.\n",
      "<br/>Of course I know.\n",
      "You remind me every day.\n",
      "<br/>Your father left us nothing but a legacy\n",
      "of bad debts hidden by a good name.\n",
      "<br/>That name is the only card we have to play.\n",
      "<br/>I don't understand you.\n",
      "<br/>It is a fine match with Hockley.\n",
      "It will ensure our survival.\n",
      "<br/>How can you put this on me?\n",
      "<br/>Why are you being so selfish?\n",
      "<br/>I'm being selfish?\n",
      "<br/>Do you want to see me\n",
      "working as a seamstress?\n",
      "<br/>Is that what you want?\n",
      "<br/>To see our fine things sold at auction?\n",
      "<br/>Our memories scattered?\n",
      "<br/>It's so unfair.\n",
      "<br/>Of course it's unfair.\n",
      "<br/>We're women.\n",
      "<br/>Our choices are never easy.\n",
      "<br/>Protect them by Thy guiding hand\n",
      "<br/>From every peril on the land\n",
      "<br/>O, spirit whom the Father sent\n",
      "<br/>To spread abroad the firmament\n",
      "<br/>O, wind of heaven, by Thy might\n",
      "<br/>Save all who dare the eagle 's ﬂight\n",
      "<br/>And keep them by Thy watchful care...\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>I need to talk to someone.\n",
      "<br/>You're not supposed to be in here.\n",
      "<br/>I was here last night, remember?\n",
      "<br/>No. Now please turn around.\n",
      "<br/>He'll tell you. I just need to talk--\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...\n",
      "<br/>...are still appreciative of your assistance.\n",
      "<br/>They asked me\n",
      "to give you this in gratitude--\n",
      "<br/>I don't want your money.\n",
      "<br/>--And remind you you are\n",
      "in third class and your presence here...\n",
      "<br/>...is no longer appropriate.\n",
      "<br/>Let me speak to Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson\n",
      "returns to where he belongs...\n",
      "<br/>...and that he stays there?\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Come along, you.\n",
      "<br/>Hear us when we cry to Thee\n",
      "<br/>For those in peril on the sea\n",
      "<br/>Why are there two steering wheels?\n",
      "<br/>We use this one near shore.\n",
      "<br/>Excuse me, sir.\n",
      "Another ice warning, from the Noordam.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Sparks.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry.\n",
      "Quite normal for this time of year.\n",
      "<br/>In fact, we're speeding up.\n",
      "I've ordered the last boilers lit.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, son, wind it up tight\n",
      "like I showed you. That's right.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, now let it go.\n",
      "<br/>- It was good, wasn't it?\n",
      "- Quite nice. That's excellent.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Andrews...Forgive me.\n",
      "<br/>I did the sum\n",
      "in my head...\n",
      "<br/>...and with the number of lifeboats\n",
      "times the capacity you mentioned...\n",
      "<br/>Forgive me, but it seems that there are\n",
      "not enough for everyone aboard.\n",
      "<br/>About half, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Rose, you miss nothing,\n",
      "do you?\n",
      "<br/>In fact, I put in these new\n",
      "type davits...\n",
      "<br/>...which can take an extra row\n",
      "of boats inside this one.\n",
      "<br/>But it was thought,\n",
      "by some...\n",
      "<br/>...the deck would look\n",
      "too cluttered.\n",
      "<br/>So, I was overruled.\n",
      "<br/>It's a waste of deck space\n",
      "as it is on an unsinkable ship.\n",
      "<br/>Sleep soundly, young Rose.\n",
      "<br/>I have built you a good ship,\n",
      "strong and true.\n",
      "<br/>She's all the lifeboat\n",
      "you need.\n",
      "<br/>Just keep heading aft. The next\n",
      "stop will be the engine room.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, this is impossible.\n",
      "I can't see you.\n",
      "<br/>- I need to talk to you.\n",
      "- No, Jack. No.\n",
      "<br/>Jack.\n",
      "I'm engaged.\n",
      "<br/>I'm marrying Cal.\n",
      "<br/>I love Cal.\n",
      "<br/>Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...you're no picnic. All right?\n",
      "You're a spoiled little brat even.\n",
      "<br/>But under that, you're the\n",
      "most amazingly, astounding\n",
      "<br/>...wonderful girl...\n",
      "<br/>...woman, that I've ever known.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, I--\n",
      "<br/>No, let me try and get\n",
      "this out. You're ama--\n",
      "<br/>I'm not an idiot.\n",
      "I know how the world works.\n",
      "<br/>I've got ten bucks\n",
      "in my pocket.\n",
      "<br/>I have nothing to offer\n",
      "you and I know that.\n",
      "<br/>I understand.\n",
      "<br/>But I'm too involved now.\n",
      "<br/>You jump, I jump\n",
      "Remember?\n",
      "<br/>I can't turn away without\n",
      "knowing you'll be all right.\n",
      "<br/>That's all that I want.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I'm fine.\n",
      "<br/>I'll be fine. Really.\n",
      "<br/>Really?\n",
      "<br/>I don't think so.\n",
      "<br/>They've got you trapped, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>And you're gonna die if you\n",
      "don't break free.\n",
      "<br/>Maybe not right away...\n",
      "<br/>...because you're strong...\n",
      "<br/>...but sooner or later that\n",
      "fire that I love about you, Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...that fire is gonna\n",
      "burn out.\n",
      "<br/>It's not up to you\n",
      "to save me, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>You're right.\n",
      "<br/>Only you can do that.\n",
      "<br/>I'm going back.\n",
      "<br/>Leave me alone.\n",
      "<br/>Tell Lucile about the disaster\n",
      "you had with the stationers.\n",
      "<br/>Well, of course the invitations\n",
      "had to be sent back, twice.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, my dear.\n",
      "<br/>And the dreadful\n",
      "bridesmaids' gowns.\n",
      "<br/>Let me tell you what an\n",
      "odyssey that has been.\n",
      "<br/>Rose decided she\n",
      "wanted lavender.\n",
      "<br/>She knows I detest the color.\n",
      "<br/>So, she did it only to spite me.\n",
      "<br/>If only you'd come to\n",
      "me sooner.\n",
      "<br/>Ruth saw some of my designs in\n",
      "La Mode Illustrée.\n",
      "<br/>They were for the trousseau of the Duchess\n",
      "of Marlborough's youngest daughter.\n",
      "<br/>They were quite charming.\n",
      "<br/>But, I think you'll agree,\n",
      "my dear, that together...\n",
      "<br/>...we've created something\n",
      "of a phoenix from the ashes.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>I changed my mind.\n",
      "<br/>They said you might be up here.\n",
      "<br/>Give me your hand.\n",
      "<br/>Now close your eyes.\n",
      "<br/>Go on.\n",
      "<br/>Now, step up.\n",
      "<br/>Now, hold onto the railing.\n",
      "<br/>Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "Don't peek.\n",
      "<br/>I'm not.\n",
      "<br/>Now, step up onto the rail.\n",
      "<br/>Hold on. Hold on.\n",
      "<br/>Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "<br/>Do you trust me?\n",
      "<br/>I trust you.\n",
      "<br/>All right...\n",
      "<br/>---Open your eyes.\n",
      "<br/>I'm flying.\n",
      "<br/>Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Come, Josephine, in my\n",
      "ﬂying machine. Going up...\n",
      "<br/>...she goes. Up she goes.\n",
      "<br/>That was the last time\n",
      "Titanic ever saw daylight.\n",
      "<br/>We're up to dusk the\n",
      "night of the sinking.\n",
      "<br/>6 hours to go.\n",
      "<br/>Incredible. There's Smith and\n",
      "he's standing there and...\n",
      "<br/>...he's got the iceberg warning\n",
      "in his fucking hand...\n",
      "<br/>...excuse me--his hand,\n",
      "and he's ordering more speed.\n",
      "<br/>26 years of experience\n",
      "working against him.\n",
      "<br/>He figures anything big\n",
      "enough to sink, the ship...\n",
      "<br/>...they're gonna see in time to turn.\n",
      "<br/>But the ship's too big\n",
      "with too small a rudder.\n",
      "<br/>Doesn't corner worth a damn.\n",
      "<br/>Everything he knows\n",
      "is wrong.\n",
      "<br/>It's quite proper, I assure you.\n",
      "This is the sitting room.\n",
      "<br/>- Will this light do?\n",
      "- What?\n",
      "<br/>Don't artists need good light?\n",
      "<br/>That is true, but I'm not\n",
      "used to working in...\n",
      "<br/>...such horrible conditions.\n",
      "<br/>Monet!\n",
      "<br/>- Do you know his work?\n",
      "- Of course.\n",
      "<br/>Look at his use of color here.\n",
      "Isn't he great?\n",
      "<br/>I know. It's extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>Cal insists on carting\n",
      "this hideous thing everywhere.\n",
      "<br/>Should we be expecting him\n",
      "any time soon?\n",
      "<br/>Not as long as the cigars\n",
      "and brandy hold out.\n",
      "<br/>That's nice.\n",
      "<br/>What is it,\n",
      "a sapphire?\n",
      "<br/>A diamond.\n",
      "<br/>A very rare diamond.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, I want you to draw me\n",
      "like one of your French girls.\n",
      "<br/>Wearing this.\n",
      "<br/>All right.\n",
      "<br/>Wearing only this.\n",
      "<br/>The last thing I need is another picture of me\n",
      "looking like a porcelain doll.\n",
      "<br/>As a paying customer...\n",
      "<br/>...I expect to get\n",
      "what I want.\n",
      "<br/>Over on the bed\n",
      "...uh, the couch.\n",
      "<br/>Come. Lie down.\n",
      "<br/>- Tell me when it looks right.\n",
      "- Keep that.\n",
      "<br/>Put your arm back\n",
      "the way it was.\n",
      "<br/>Put that other arm up,\n",
      "that hand right by your face there.\n",
      "<br/>Right.\n",
      "<br/>Now, head down.\n",
      "<br/>Eyes to me.\n",
      "Keep them on me.\n",
      "<br/>And try to stay still.\n",
      "<br/>So serious.\n",
      "<br/>I believe you are blushing,\n",
      "Mr. Big Artiste.\n",
      "<br/>I can't imagine\n",
      "Monsieur Monet blushing.\n",
      "<br/>He does landscapes.\n",
      "<br/>- Just relax your face.\n",
      "- Sorry.\n",
      "<br/>No laughing.\n",
      "<br/>My heart was pounding\n",
      "the whole time.\n",
      "<br/>It was the most erotic\n",
      "moment of my life...\n",
      "<br/>...up until then, at least.\n",
      "<br/>So what happened next?\n",
      "<br/>You mean,\n",
      "did we do it?\n",
      "<br/>Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.\n",
      "<br/>Jack was very professional.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>What are you doing?\n",
      "<br/>Will you put this\n",
      "back in the safe for me?\n",
      "<br/>Gentlemen, would you excuse me.\n",
      "<br/>None of the stewards\n",
      "have seen her.\n",
      "<br/>This is absurd.\n",
      "It's a ship.\n",
      "<br/>There's only so many\n",
      "places she could be.\n",
      "<br/>Lovejoy, find her.\n",
      "<br/>- Clear.\n",
      "- Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I don't think I've ever\n",
      "seen such a flat calm.\n",
      "<br/>Like a mill pond.\n",
      "<br/>Not a breath of wind.\n",
      "<br/>It will make the bergs\n",
      "harder to see---\n",
      "<br/>...with no breaking\n",
      "water at the base.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I'm off.\n",
      "<br/>Maintain speed and\n",
      "heading, Mr. Lightoller.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>It's getting cold.\n",
      "You look nice.\n",
      "<br/>Miss Rose?\n",
      "<br/>My drawings!\n",
      "<br/>Come on!\n",
      "<br/>Wait, wait, wait!\n",
      "<br/>Wait, wait, wait!\n",
      "<br/>- Go. Go. Down, down.\n",
      "- Take us down, quickly. Quickly!\n",
      "<br/>Bye.\n",
      "<br/>Sorry.\n",
      "<br/>- Keep going.\n",
      "- Thank you, I've got it.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty tough for\n",
      "a valet, this fella.\n",
      "<br/>Seems more like a cop.\n",
      "<br/>I think he was.\n",
      "<br/>- Oh, shit.\n",
      "- Go!\n",
      "<br/>No, over here!\n",
      "<br/>Quick!\n",
      "<br/>Now what?\n",
      "<br/>Wh at?\n",
      "<br/>More coal for number\n",
      "one, mate.\n",
      "<br/>Hold up? What are you two\n",
      "doing down here?\n",
      "<br/>You shouldn't be down here.\n",
      "<br/>It could be dangerous!\n",
      "<br/>Carry on!\n",
      "<br/>Don't mind us. You're\n",
      "doing a great job!\n",
      "<br/>Keep up the good work!\n",
      "<br/>Look at what we have here, huh?\n",
      "<br/>Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Where to, miss?\n",
      "<br/>To the stars.\n",
      "<br/>You nervous?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Put your hands on me, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>It's bloody cold.\n",
      "<br/>You know, I can smell ice, you know.\n",
      "When it's near.\n",
      "<br/>Bollocks!\n",
      "<br/>Well, I can, all right?\n",
      "<br/>Did you ever find those\n",
      "binoculars for the lookouts?\n",
      "<br/>Haven't seen them\n",
      "since Southampton.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I'll be on\n",
      "my rounds.\n",
      "<br/>Cheerio.\n",
      "<br/>You're trembling.\n",
      "<br/>Don't worry.\n",
      "<br/>I'll be all right.\n",
      "<br/>- They ran down there.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "<br/>Anything missing?\n",
      "<br/>I have a better idea.\n",
      "<br/>GOI you!\n",
      "<br/>Did you see those guys' faces?\n",
      "<br/>Did you see them?\n",
      "<br/>When the ship docks...\n",
      "<br/>...I'm getting off with you.\n",
      "<br/>This is crazy.\n",
      "<br/>I know. It doesn't make any sense.\n",
      "<br/>That's why I trust it.\n",
      "<br/>Here, look at this.\n",
      "<br/>Look at that, would you?\n",
      "<br/>They're warmer than we are.\n",
      "<br/>If that's what it takes for us to get warm,\n",
      "I'd rather not.\n",
      "<br/>Bugger me!\n",
      "<br/>Pick up, you bastards!\n",
      "<br/>Is anyone there?!\n",
      "<br/>What do you see?\n",
      "<br/>Iceberg, right ahead!\n",
      "<br/>Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Iceberg ahead!\n",
      "<br/>Hard a' starboard!\n",
      "<br/>Turn! Turn! Srnartly!\n",
      "<br/>Full astern!\n",
      "<br/>Hard over.\n",
      "<br/>Helm's hard over, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Go, lads, go!\n",
      "<br/>Bring that steam down! Bring it down!\n",
      "<br/>Shut all the dampers! Shut them!\n",
      "<br/>Hold it.\n",
      "<br/>Hold it!\n",
      "<br/>Now! Engage reversing engine!\n",
      "<br/>Why ain't they turning?\n",
      "<br/>Is it hard over?!\n",
      "<br/>It is, sir. Hard over.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, come on, come on. Turn.\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>It's going to hit!\n",
      "<br/>Jesus Christ!\n",
      "<br/>Jesus!\n",
      "<br/>Hard to port!\n",
      "<br/>Hard to port!\n",
      "<br/>Get back!\n",
      "<br/>Let's go!\n",
      "<br/>They're closing the doors! Get out!\n",
      "<br/>Get out the door! Go!\n",
      "<br/>Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!\n",
      "<br/>Go! Go!\n",
      "<br/>Out! Out!\n",
      "<br/>Oh, my God.\n",
      "<br/>That was a close shave.\n",
      "<br/>Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!\n",
      "<br/>Note the time. Enter it in the log.\n",
      "<br/>What was that, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br/>An iceberg, sir.\n",
      "<br/>I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close.\n",
      "<br/>I tried to port round it, but--\n",
      "<br/>- Close the watertight doors.\n",
      "- They're closed, sir.\n",
      "<br/>All stop.\n",
      "<br/>Have the carpenter sound the ship.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, let's get the hell out of here!\n",
      "<br/>Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.\n",
      "<br/>That's the shudder you felt.\n",
      "Do you need anything?\n",
      "<br/>No, thank you.\n",
      "<br/>There's talk of an iceberg.\n",
      "<br/>I don't see anything. Do you?\n",
      "<br/>If this is where the rats are going, I am, too.\n",
      "<br/>- You.\n",
      "- There is no emergency.\n",
      "<br/>- There is. I've been robbed.\n",
      "- Get the Master at Arms.\n",
      "<br/>Now, you moron!\n",
      "<br/>Did I miss the fun?\n",
      "<br/>- Did you see what happened?\n",
      "- No- I guess it hit over there-\n",
      "<br/>Boiler room six is flooded eight feet\n",
      "and the mail hold is worse.\n",
      "<br/>- Can you shore up?\n",
      "- Not unless the pumps get ahead.\n",
      "<br/>- Have you seen the mail hold?\n",
      "- It's already underwater.\n",
      "<br/>This is bad.\n",
      "<br/>We should tell Mother and Cal.\n",
      "<br/>I think they're very good, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Don't touch anything.\n",
      "I want the room photographed.\n",
      "<br/>We've been looking for you, miss.\n",
      "<br/>Here we go.\n",
      "<br/>Something serious has happened.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, it has.\n",
      "<br/>Indeed.\n",
      "Two things dear to me have disappeared.\n",
      "<br/>Now that one is back,\n",
      "I know where to find the other. Search him.\n",
      "<br/>- Take your coat off.\n",
      "- Now what?\n",
      "<br/>What are you doing?\n",
      "We're in the middle of an emergency.\n",
      "<br/>- Is this it?\n",
      "- That's it.\n",
      "<br/>This is horseshit!\n",
      "<br/>Don't you believe it.\n",
      "<br/>- He couldn't have.\n",
      "- Easy enough for a professional.\n",
      "<br/>I was with him the entire time.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps he did it while you were putting\n",
      "your clothes back on, dear.\n",
      "<br/>Real slick. They put it in my pocket.\n",
      "<br/>- Shut up.\n",
      "- It isn't even your pocket.\n",
      "<br/>\"Property of A.L. Ryerson.\"\n",
      "<br/>That was reported stolen.\n",
      "<br/>I just borrowed it.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, we have an honest thief.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do this, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Don't believe them. You know it.\n",
      "<br/>Let's go, son.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do it!\n",
      "<br/>There's a good lad. Come on.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do it! You know me!\n",
      "<br/>This is most unfortunate, Captain.\n",
      "<br/>Water fourteen feet above the keel\n",
      "in ten minutes...\n",
      "<br/>...in the forepeak,\n",
      "all three holds and boiler room six.\n",
      "<br/>That's right.\n",
      "<br/>When can we get underway?\n",
      "<br/>That's five compartments.\n",
      "<br/>She can float with four compartments breached,\n",
      "but not five.\n",
      "<br/>Not five. As she goes down,\n",
      "the water will spill...\n",
      "<br/>...over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,\n",
      "one to the next...\n",
      "<br/>...back and back. There's no stopping it.\n",
      "<br/>The pumps.\n",
      "<br/>The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.\n",
      "<br/>As of now, no matter what we do...\n",
      "<br/>...Titanic will founder.\n",
      "<br/>But this ship can't sink.\n",
      "<br/>She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.\n",
      "<br/>And she will.\n",
      "<br/>It's a mathematical certainty.\n",
      "<br/>How much time?\n",
      "<br/>An hour. Two, at most.\n",
      "<br/>How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br/>Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I believe you may get your headlines,\n",
      "Mr. lsmay.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?\n",
      "<br/>Look at me when I'm talking to you!\n",
      "<br/>- Mr. Hockley?\n",
      "- Not now. We're busy.\n",
      "<br/>You've been asked to put on lifebelts\n",
      "and go to the boat deck.\n",
      "<br/>I said, not now.\n",
      "<br/>I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.\n",
      "Dress warmly.\n",
      "<br/>It's quite cold out.\n",
      "<br/>May I suggest topcoats and hats?\n",
      "<br/>This is ridiculous.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry, miss.\n",
      "I'm sure it's just a precaution.\n",
      "<br/>Everybody up! Lifebelts on!\n",
      "<br/>What's he on about?\n",
      "<br/>- Put your lifebelts on!\n",
      "- What is it?\n",
      "<br/>Just put them on.\n",
      "<br/>C.O.D.?\n",
      "<br/>Sir?\n",
      "<br/>That's right, C.O.D. The distress call.\n",
      "That's our position.\n",
      "<br/>Tell whoever responds we're going down\n",
      "and need immediate assistance.\n",
      "<br/>Blimey.\n",
      "<br/>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br/>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br/>Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!\n",
      "<br/>Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft!\n",
      "<br/>Release those ties!\n",
      "<br/>Roll back that cover! Smartly now!\n",
      "<br/>Where are the passengers?\n",
      "<br/>They went inside- Too cold and noisy for them\n",
      "<br/>You there! Get down here\n",
      "and help with these lines!\n",
      "<br/>Care for a drink, sir?\n",
      "<br/>Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed up\n",
      "and now we're cooling our heels.\n",
      "<br/>Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.\n",
      "<br/>Nobody knows what's going on.\n",
      "<br/>Just like the damn English--everything by the book.\n",
      "<br/>No need for language, Mr. Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.\n",
      "I want a cup of tea when I return.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.\n",
      "<br/>Please tell me the truth.\n",
      "<br/>The ship will sink.\n",
      "<br/>You're certain?\n",
      "<br/>In an hour or so, all this\n",
      "will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.\n",
      "<br/>Please, tell only who you must.\n",
      "I don't want to cause a panic.\n",
      "<br/>And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.\n",
      "<br/>You remember what I told you about the boats?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I understand.\n",
      "<br/>Over here, son.\n",
      "<br/>Sir, there's a big mob\n",
      "at the Second Class Purser's office.\n",
      "<br/>Go on. I'll watch him.\n",
      "<br/>Aye. Right.\n",
      "<br/>Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.\n",
      "Full steam for them, sir.\n",
      "<br/>She's the only one responding?\n",
      "<br/>The only one close. They'll be here in four hours.\n",
      "<br/>Four hours?!\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Bride.\n",
      "<br/>My God.\n",

Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi win third-class tickets to the ship in a game.

      "<br/>Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.\n",
      "<br/>She's a goddamn liar!\n",
      "Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.\n",
      "<br/>God only knows why.\n",

      "<br/>Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the\n",
      "Titanic when she was 17, right?\n",

      "- If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.\n",
      "<br/>101 next month.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.\n",
      "<br/>Look, I've already done the\n",
      "background on this woman...\n",
      "<br/>...all the way back to the 20s,\n",
      "when she was working as an actress.\n",
      "<br/>An actress.\n",
      "There's your first clue, Sherlock.\n",
      "<br/>Her name was Rose Dawson back then.\n",
      "Then she marries this guy named Calvert.\n",
      "<br/>They move to Cedar Rapids\n",
      "and she punches out a couple of kids.\n",
      "<br/>Now Calvert's dead\n",
      "and, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.\n",
      "<br/>And everybody who knows about the\n",

      "<br/>...or on this boat,\n",
      "but she knows.\n",
      "<br/>Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?\n",

      "<br/>Can I get you anything?\n",
      "<br/>Is there anything you'd like?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I would like to\n",

      "<br/>Louis XVI wore a fabulous\n",
      "stone that was...\n",
      "<br/>...called the Blue Diamond\n",
      "of the Crown...\n",

      "in 1792...\n",
      "<br/>...about the same time old Louis lost\n",
      "everything from the neck up.\n",
      "<br/>The theory goes that the\n",
      "crown diamond was chopped, too.\n",
      "<br/>Recut into a heart-like shape that\n",
      "became known as...\n",
      "<br/>...the Heart of the Ocean.\n",
      "<br/>Today it would be worth\n",
      "more than the Hope diamond.\n",
      "<br/>It was a dreadful,\n",
      "heavy thing.\n",
      "<br/>I only wore it this once.\n",
      "<br/>You actually think\n",
      "this is you, Nana?\n",
      "<br/>It is me, dear.\n",
      "<br/>Wasn't I a dish?\n",
      "<br/>I tracked it down\n",
      "through insurance records.\n",
      "<br/>An old claim that was settled\n",
      "under terms of absolute secrecy.\n",
      "<br/>Can you tell me who the\n",
      "claimant was, Rose?\n",
      "<br/>I should imagine someone\n",
      "named Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Nathan Hockley,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "<br/>Pittsburgh steel tycoon.\n",
      "<br/>The claim was for a\n",
      "diamond necklace his son...\n",
      "<br/>...Caledon, bought his fiancée.\n",
      "<br/>You.\n",
      "<br/>A week before he\n",
      "sailed on Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>And it was filed right\n",
      "after the sinking.\n",
      "<br/>So the diamond had to have\n",
      "gone down with the ship.\n",
      "<br/>You see the date?\n",
      "<br/>April 14, 1912\n",
      "<br/>Which means if your grandmother\n",
      "is who she says she is...\n",
      "<br/>...she was wearing the diamond\n",
      "the day the Titanic sank.\n",
      "<br/>And that makes you\n",
      "my new best friend.\n",
      "<br/>These are some of the things\n",
      "we recovered from your stateroom.\n",
      "<br/>This was mine.\n",
      "<br/>How extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>And it looks the same as it\n",
      "did the last time I saw it.\n",
      "<br/>The reflection has\n",
      "changed a bit.\n",
      "<br/>Are you ready to go\n",
      "back to Titanic?\n",
      "<br/>Okay, here we go.\n",
      "<br/>She hits the berg on\n",
      "the starboard side, right?\n",
      "<br/>She kind of bumps along...\n",
      "<br/>...punching holes like\n",
      "morse code...\n",
      "<br/>-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...\n",
      "<br/>...below the waterline.\n",
      "<br/>Then the forward compartments\n",
      "start to flood.\n",
      "<br/>Now, as the water\n",
      "level rises...\n",
      "<br/>...it spills over the\n",
      "watertight bulkheads...\n",
      "<br/>which, unfortunately, don't go\n",
      "any higher than E deck-\n",
      "<br/>So now as the\n",
      "bow goes down...\n",
      "<br/>...the stern rises up,\n",
      "slow at first...\n",
      "<br/>...then faster and faster...\n",
      "<br/>...until finally, she's got her whole\n",
      "ass sticking up in the air.\n",
      "<br/>And that's a big ass.\n",
      "<br/>We're talking\n",
      "20, 30,000 tons. Okay?\n",
      "<br/>And the hull's not designed\n",
      "to deal with that pressure.\n",
      "<br/>So, what happens?\n",
      "<br/>She splits, right\n",
      "down to the keel.\n",
      "<br/>And the stern...\n",
      "<br/>...falls back level.\n",
      "<br/>Then...\n",
      "<br/>...as the bow sinks...\n",
      "<br/>...it pulls the stern vertical...\n",
      "<br/>...and then finally detaches.\n",
      "<br/>Now the stern section just kind of bobs\n",
      "there like a cork for a couple of minutes...\n",
      "<br/>...floods, and finally goes\n",
      "under about 2:20 AM...\n",
      "<br/>...2 hours and 40 minutes\n",
      "after the collision.\n",
      "<br/>The bow section\n",
      "planes away...\n",
      "<br/>...landing about a\n",
      "half a mile away...\n",
      "<br/>...going 20, 30 knots when\n",
      "it hits the ocean floor.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty cool, huh?\n",
      "<br/>Thank you for that fine\n",
      "forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.\n",
      "<br/>Of course, the\n",
      "experience of it was...\n",
      "<br/>...somewhat different.\n",
      "<br/>Will you share it with us?\n",
      "<br/>I'm taking her to rest.\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, Nana.\n",
      "<br/>No!\n",
      "<br/>Give me the\n",
      "tape recorder.\n",
      "<br/>Tell us, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>It's been 84 years--\n",
      "<br/>It's okay. Just try\n",
      "to remember anything...\n",
      "<br/>...anything at all.\n",
      "<br/>Do you want to hear this\n",
      "or not, Mr. Lovett?\n",
      "<br/>It's been 84 years...\n",

      "never been used.\n",
      "<br/>The sheets had\n",

      "<br/>I don't see what all\n",
      "the fuss is about.\n",
      "<br/>It doesn't look any bigger\n",
      "than the Mauretania.\n",
      "<br/>You can be blasé\n",
      "about some things, Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...but not about Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>It's over 100 feet longer\n",

      "saying it wouldn't.\n",
      "<br/>Tell you the truth...\n",
      "<br/>...I'm a lot more concerned\n",
      "about that water being so cold.\n",
      "<br/>How cold?\n",
      "<br/>Freezing.\n",
      "Maybe a couple degrees over.\n",
      "<br/>You ever, uh...\n",
      "<br/>...ever been\n",
      "to Wisconsin?\n",
      "<br/>Wh at?\n",
      "<br/>Well, they have some of\n",
      "the coldest winters around.\n",
      "<br/>I grew up there,\n",
      "near Chippewa Falls.\n",
      "<br/>I remember when I was a kid,\n",
      "me and my father, we went ice fishing...\n",
      "<br/>...out on Lake Wissota.\n",
      "<br/>Ice fishing is, you know, where you--\n",
      "<br/>I know what ice fishing is!\n",
      "<br/>Sorry.\n",
      "<br/>You just seem like, you know,\n",
      "kind of an indoor girl.\n",
      "<br/>Anyway, I...\n",
      "<br/>...fell through some thin ice.\n",
      "<br/>And I'm telling you...\n",
      "<br/>...water that cold,\n",
      "<br/>like right down there...\n",
      "<br/>...it hits you like 1000 knives\n",
      "stabbing you all over your body.\n",
      "<br/>You can't breathe.\n",
      "<br/>You can't think. Least not about\n",
      "anything but the pain.\n",
      "<br/>Which is why I'm not looking\n",
      "forward to jumping in there after you.\n",
      "<br/>Like I said...\n",
      "<br/>...I don't have a choice.\n",
      "<br/>I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll\n",
      "come back over the rail and...\n",
      "<br/>...and get me off\n",
      "the hook here.\n",
      "<br/>You're crazy.\n",
      "<br/>That's what everybody says but...\n",
      "<br/>...with all due respect, miss...\n",
      "<br/>...I'm not the one hanging off\n",
      "the back of a ship here.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, give me your hand.\n",
      "<br/>You don't want to do this.\n",
      "<br/>I'm Jack Dawson.\n",
      "<br/>Rose DeWitt Bu kater.\n",
      "<br/>I'll have to get you to\n",
      "write that one down.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>I got you.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>Help, please!\n",
      "<br/>Help!\n",
      "<br/>- Please, help me!\n",
      "- Listen. Listen to me.\n",
      "<br/>Listen. Listen to me.\n",
      "<br/>I've got you.\n",
      "I won't let go.\n",
      "<br/>Now pull yourself up.\n",
      "Come on!\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>That's right.\n",
      "<br/>You can do it.\n",
      "<br/>I got you.\n",
      "<br/>What's all this?\n",
      "<br/>You stand back and...\n",
      "<br/>...don't move an inch!\n",
      "<br/>Fetch the Master at Arms.\n",
      "<br/>This is completely unacceptable!\n",
      "<br/>What made you think that you could\n",

      "<br/>Look at me, you filth!\n",
      "<br/>Cal.\n",
      "<br/>What do you think\n",
      "you were doing?\n",
      "<br/>Cal, stop.\n",
      "It was an accident.\n",
      "<br/>An accident?\n",
      "<br/>It was.\n",
      "<br/>Stupid, really.\n",
      "<br/>I was leaning over and I slipped.\n",
      "<br/>I was leaning far over\n",
      "to see the, uh...\n",
      "<br/>...uh, uh, the uh...\n",
      "<br/>- Propellers?\n",
      "- Propellers, and I slipped.\n",
      "<br/>And I would have gone\n",
      "overboard but Mr. Dawson here...\n",
      "<br/>...saved me. And almost\n",
      "went over himself.\n",
      "<br/>You wanted to see the...\n",
      "She wanted to see the propellers.\n",
      "<br/>Like I said, women and\n",
      "machinery do not mix.\n",
      "<br/>Was that the way of it?\n",
      "<br/>Yeah. Yeah, that\n",
      "was pretty much it.\n",
      "<br/>Well, the boy's a hero then.\n",
      "<br/>Good for you, son.\n",
      "Well done.\n",
      "<br/>So, it's all's well and back\n",
      "to our brandy, eh?\n",
      "<br/>Look at you. You must be freezing.\n",
      "Let's get you inside.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps a little something\n",
      "for the boy?\n",
      "<br/>Of course.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Lovejoy,\n",
      "I think a 20 should do it.\n",
      "<br/>Is that the going rate\n",
      "for saving the woman you love?\n",
      "<br/>Rose is displeased.\n",
      "<br/>What to do?\n",
      "<br/>I know.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps you could join us for\n",
      "dinner tomorrow evening...\n",
      "<br/>...to regale our group...\n",
      "<br/>...with your heroic tale.\n",
      "<br/>Sure.\n",
      "Count me in.\n",
      "<br/>Good.\n",
      "It's settled then.\n",
      "<br/>This should be interesting.\n",
      "<br/>Can I bum a smoke?\n",
      "<br/>You'll want to tie those.\n",
      "<br/>It's interesting...\n",
      "<br/>...the young lady slipped\n",
      "so suddenly...\n",
      "<br/>...and you still had time to remove\n",
      "your jacket and your shoes.\n",
      "<br/>I know you've been melancholy.\n",
      "<br/>I don't pretend to know why.\n",
      "<br/>I intended to save this...\n",
      "<br/>...until the engagement\n",
      "gala next week...\n",
      "<br/>...but, I thought...\n",
      "<br/>...tonight.\n",
      "<br/>Good gracious.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps as a reminder\n",
      "of my feelings for you.\n",
      "<br/>- Is it a--\n",
      "- Diamond. Yes.\n",
      "<br/>56 carats to be exact.\n",
      "<br/>It was worn by Louis XVI.\n",
      "<br/>And they called\n",
      "it Le Coeur de Ia Mer.\n",
      "<br/>- The Heart of the Ocean.\n",
      "- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.\n",
      "<br/>It's overwhelming.\n",
      "<br/>Well, it's for royalty.\n",
      "<br/>We are royalty, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>You know, there's\n",
      "nothing I couldn't give you.\n",
      "<br/>There's nothing I'd deny you...\n",
      "<br/>...if you would not deny me.\n",
      "<br/>Open your heart to me, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I've been on my own since\n",
      "I was 15, since my folks died.\n",
      "<br/>And I had no brothers or sisters or\n",
      "close kin in that part of the country...\n",
      "<br/>...so I lit on out of there and I\n",
      "haven't been back since.\n",
      "<br/>You could just call me a\n",
      "tumbleweed blowing in the wind.\n",
      "<br/>Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile\n",
      "around this boat deck and...\n",
      "<br/>...chewed over how great the weather's\n",
      "been and how I grew up...\n",
      "<br/>...but I reckon that's not why\n",
      "you came to talk to me, is it?\n",
      "<br/>- Mr. Dawson, I--\n",
      "- Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Jack.\n",
      "<br/>I want to thank you\n",
      "for what you did.\n",
      "<br/>Not just for pulling me back,\n",
      "but for your discretion.\n",
      "<br/>You're welcome.\n",
      "<br/>Look.\n",
      "<br/>I know what you\n",
      "must be thinking.\n",
      "<br/>Poor little rich girl.\n",
      "<br/>What does she know about misery?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>No, that's not what I was thinking.\n",
      "<br/>What I was thinking was...\n",
      "<br/>---what could have happened to this girl\n",
      "to make her think she had no way out?\n",
      "<br/>Well I...\n",
      "<br/>It was everything.\n",
      "It was my whole world and...\n",
      "<br/>...all the people in it.\n",
      "<br/>And the inertia of my life,\n",
      "plunging ahead and me...\n",
      "<br/>...powerless to stop it.\n",
      "<br/>God,\n",
      "look at that thing.\n",
      "<br/>You would have gone\n",
      "straight to the bottom.\n",
      "<br/>500 invitations have gone out.\n",
      "<br/>All of Philadelphia society will be there.\n",
      "<br/>And all the while I feel I'm...\n",
      "<br/>...standing in the middle\n",
      "of a crowded room...\n",
      "<br/>...screaming at the\n",
      "top of my lungs...\n",
      "<br/>...and no one\n",
      "even looks up.\n",
      "<br/>Do you love him?\n",
      "<br/>Pardon me?\n",
      "<br/>Do you love him?\n",
      "<br/>You're being very rude. You\n",
      "shouldn't be asking me this.\n",
      "<br/>Well, it's a simple question.\n",
      "Do you love the guy or not?\n",
      "<br/>This is not a suitable conversation.\n",
      "<br/>VVhy can't you just\n",
      "answer the question?\n",
      "<br/>This is absurd.\n",
      "<br/>You don't know me\n",
      "and I don't know you...\n",
      "<br/>...and we are not having this\n",
      "conversation at all. You are rude...\n",
      "<br/>...and uncouth and presumptuous\n",
      "and I am leaving now...\n",
      "<br/>...Jack. Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "It's been a pleasure.\n",
      "<br/>I sought you out to thank you\n",
      "and now I have thanked you.\n",
      "<br/>And you've insulted me.\n",
      "<br/>Well, you deserved it.\n",
      "<br/>- Right.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "<br/>I thought you were leaving.\n",
      "<br/>I am.\n",
      "<br/>You are so annoying.\n",
      "<br/>Wait.\n",
      "<br/>I don't have to leave. This is\n",
      "my part of the ship. You leave.\n",
      "<br/>Well, well, well.\n",
      "Now who's being rude?\n",
      "<br/>What is this stupid thing\n",
      "you're carrying around?\n",
      "<br/>So, what are you,\n",
      "an artist or something?\n",
      "<br/>These are rather good.\n",
      "<br/>They're very good, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, this is exquisite work.\n",
      "<br/>Ah, they didn't think too\n",
      "much of them in old Paree.\n",
      "<br/>Paris?\n",
      "<br/>You do get around\n",
      "for a p--\n",
      "<br/>Well, a-- a\n",
      "person of limited means.\n",
      "<br/>Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.\n",
      "<br/>Well, well, well.\n",
      "<br/>And these were drawn from life?\n",
      "<br/>Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.\n",
      "<br/>Lots of girls are willing\n",
      "to take their clothes off.\n",
      "<br/>You liked this woman.\n",
      "<br/>You used her several times.\n",
      "<br/>Well.\n",
      "<br/>She had beautiful\n",
      "hands, you see?\n",
      "<br/>I think you must have\n",
      "had a love affair with her.\n",
      "<br/>No, no, no.\n",
      "Just with her hands.\n",
      "<br/>She was a\n",
      "one-legged prostitute.\n",
      "<br/>See?\n",
      "<br/>She had a good\n",
      "sense of humor though.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, and this lady...\n",
      "<br/>She used to sit at this bar every night...\n",
      "<br/>...wearing every piece\n",
      "of jewelry she owned...\n",
      "<br/>...just waiting for\n",
      "her long, lost love.\n",
      "<br/>We called her Madame Bijoux.\n",
      "<br/>See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.\n",
      "<br/>Well,\n",
      "you have a gift, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>You do.\n",
      "<br/>You see people.\n",
      "<br/>I see you.\n",
      "<br/>And?\n",
      "<br/>You wouldn't have jumped.\n",
      "<br/>But the purpose of university\n",
      "is to find a suitable husband.\n",
      "<br/>Rose has already done that.\n",
      "<br/>Look, here comes that\n",
      "vulgar Brown woman.\n",
      "<br/>Quickly, get up before\n",
      "she sits with us.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, girls. I was hoping\n",
      "I'd catch you at tea.\n",
      "<br/>We're awfully sorry,\n",
      "you missed it.\n",
      "<br/>The Countess and I were just\n",
      "off to take the air on the boat deck.\n",
      "<br/>What a lovely idea.\n",
      "I need to catch up on my gossip.\n",
      "<br/>Countess.\n",
      "<br/>So, you've not yet lit the\n",
      "last four boilers?\n",
      "<br/>No, I don't see\n",
      "the need.\n",
      "<br/>We are making excellent time.\n",
      "<br/>The press knows the size of Titanic.\n",
      "Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.\n",
      "<br/>We must give them\n",
      "something new to print.\n",
      "<br/>This maiden voyage\n",
      "of Titanic must...\n",
      "<br/>...make headlines.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. lsmay, I would prefer\n",
      "not to push the engines...\n",
      "<br/>...until they've been properly run in.\n",
      "<br/>Of course I'm just a passenger.\n",
      "<br/>I leave it to your good offices\n",
      "to decide what's best.\n",
      "<br/>But what a glorious end to your final crossing...\n",
      "<br/>...if we were to get into New York\n",
      "on Tuesday night...\n",
      "<br/>...and surprise them all.\n",
      "Make the morning papers.\n",
      "<br/>Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?\n",
      "<br/>Good man.\n",
      "<br/>After that, I worked\n",
      "on a squid boat in Monterey...\n",
      "<br/>...then I went to Los Angeles to the...\n",
      "<br/>...Santa Monica pier\n",
      "and did portraits for 10 cents each.\n",
      "<br/>Why can't I be like you?\n",
      "<br/>Just head out for the horizon\n",
      "whenever I feel like it.\n",
      "<br/>Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...\n",
      "<br/>only if we just talk about it\n",
      "<br/>No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.\n",
      "<br/>Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up\n",
      "<br/>We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.\n",
      "<br/>But you have to do it like a real cowboy.\n",
      "No sidesaddle stuff.\n",
      "<br/>You mean with one leg on each side?\n",
      "<br/>Can you show me?\n",
      "<br/>Sure, if you like.\n",
      "<br/>Teach me to ride like a man.\n",
      "<br/>Chew tobacco like a man.\n",
      "<br/>And spit like a man.\n",
      "<br/>You didn't learn in finishing school?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, I'll show you.\n",
      "<br/>I'll show you how.\n",
      "<br/>Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.\n",
      "<br/>I couldn't possibly, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Watch closely.\n",
      "<br/>That's disgusting.\n",
      "<br/>Your turn\n",
      "<br/>That was pitiful.\n",
      "You really have to hawk it back.\n",
      "<br/>Get some leverage.\n",
      "Use your arms. Arc your neck.\n",
      "<br/>You see the range on that thing?\n",
      "<br/>Okay, go.\n",
      "<br/>That was better. You have to work on it.\n",
      "Really try to hawk it up.\n",
      "<br/>Mother.\n",
      "<br/>May I introduce Jack Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>Charmed, I'm sure.\n",
      "<br/>The others were gracious and curious\n",
      "about the man who'd saved my life.\n",
      "<br/>But my mother looked at him like an insect.\n",
      "<br/>A dangerous insect\n",
      "which must be squashed quickly.\n",
      "<br/>Sounds like you're a good man\n",
      "to have around in a sticky spot.\n",
      "<br/>Why do they always insist on announcing\n",
      "dinner like a damn cavalry charge?\n",
      "<br/>Shall we go dress, Mother?\n",
      "<br/>See you at dinner, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Uh, son?\n",
      "<br/>Son!\n",
      "<br/>Do you have any idea what you're doing?\n",
      "<br/>Not really.\n",
      "<br/>You're about to go into the snake pit.\n",
      "<br/>What are you going to wear?\n",
      "<br/>I figured. Come on.\n",
      "<br/>I was right. You and my son\n",
      "are just about the same size.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty close.\n",
      "<br/>You shine up like a new penny.\n",
      "<br/>Good evening, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Thousands of tons of Hockley steel\n",
      "are in this ship.\n",
      "<br/>- Which part?\n",
      "- All the right ones.\n",
      "<br/>Then you're accountable\n",
      "if there's a problem. Where's Rose?\n",
      "<br/>She'll be along.\n",
      "<br/>There is the Countess.\n",
      "<br/>I saw that in a nickelodeon\n",
      "and always wanted to do it.\n",
      "<br/>Darling...\n",
      "<br/>...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "<br/>It's amazing.\n",
      "You could almost pass for a gentleman.\n",
      "<br/>Almost.\n",
      "<br/>This is extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>This is a remarkable voyage.\n",
      "<br/>- Mad.\n",
      "- Completely lunatic.\n",
      "<br/>There's the Countess of Rothes.\n",
      "<br/>That's John Jacob Astor...\n",
      "<br/>...the richest man on board.\n",
      "<br/>His little wifey, Madeleine,\n",
      "is my age and in a delicate condition.\n",
      "<br/>See how she tries to hide it.\n",
      "<br/>Quite the scandal.\n",
      "<br/>Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,\n",
      "Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...\n",
      "<br/>...is at home with the children, of course.\n",

      "<br/>She designs naughty lingerie,\n",

      "<br/>Very popular with the royals.\n",
      "<br/>Congratulations. She's splendid.\n",
      "<br/>Why, thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Escort a lady to dinner?\n",
      "<br/>Certainly.\n",
      "<br/>Sweet pea, sweet pea.\n",
      "<br/>Ain't nothing to it.\n",
      "<br/>They love money. Pretend like you own\n",

      "<br/>Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.\n",
      "<br/>J.J., Madeleine,\n",

      "<br/>No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br/>He must have been nervous,\n",

      "<br/>New money, obviously,\n",
      "but still a member of the club.\n",
      "<br/>Mother, of course,\n",
      "could always be counted upon.\n",
      "<br/>Tell us of the accommodations in steerage\n",
      "Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good-\n",
      "<br/>The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.\n",
      "<br/>He was of help to my fiancée last night.\n",
      "<br/>It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.\n",
      "<br/>He showed me some of his work today.\n",
      "<br/>Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.\n",
      "Not to impugn your work, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Are all these mine?\n",
      "<br/>Start from the outside and work in.\n",
      "<br/>He knows every rivet in her.\n",
      "<br/>Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>How do you take your caviar, sir?\n",
      "<br/>No caviar for me, thanks.\n",
      "Never did like it much.\n",
      "<br/>Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>After that, I'm on God's good humor.\n",
      "<br/>How do you have means to travel?\n",
      "<br/>I work my way from place to place.\n",
      "Tramp steamers and such.\n",
      "<br/>I won my ticket on Titanic\n",
      "at a lucky hand at poker.\n",
      "<br/>A very lucky hand.\n",
      "<br/>All life is a game of luck.\n",
      "<br/>A real man makes his own luck.\n",
      "Right, Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>And you find\n",
      "that sort of rootless existence appealing?\n",
      "<br/>Yes, ma'am, I do.\n",
      "<br/>I've got everything I need\n",
      "right here with me.\n",
      "<br/>I have air in my lungs\n",
      "and blank sheets of paper.\n",
      "<br/>I love waking up, not knowing\n",
      "what will happen or who I'll meet.\n",
      "<br/>Where I'll wind up.\n",
      "<br/>One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...\n",
      "<br/>...now I'm on the grandest ship\n",
      "in the world, with you fine people.\n",
      "<br/>I'll take more of that.\n",
      "<br/>Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.\n",
      "<br/>You never know what hand you'll get dealt.\n",
      "<br/>You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.\n",
      "<br/>Make each day count.\n",
      "<br/>Well said, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Hear, hear.\n",
      "<br/>To making it count.\n",
      "<br/>To making it count.\n",
      "<br/>Bravo.\n",
      "<br/>But Mr. Brown didn't know\n",
      "I'd hidden the money in the stove.\n",
      "<br/>He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating\n",
      "and lights a fire.\n",
      "<br/>Next is brandy in the smoking room.\n",
      "<br/>Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?\n",
      "<br/>Now they retreat to congratulate each\n",
      "other on being masters of the universe.\n",
      "<br/>Ladies, thank you for your company.\n",
      "<br/>May I escort you to the cabin?\n",
      "<br/>No, I'll stay here.\n",
      "<br/>Here, Molly.\n",
      "<br/>Joining us, Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>You don't want to stay with the women.\n",
      "<br/>No, thanks. I have to head back.\n",
      "<br/>That's best. It'll be all business and politics.\n",
      "Wouldn't interest you.\n",
      "<br/>But Dawson, good of you to come.\n",
      "<br/>Must you go?\n",
      "<br/>Time for me to row with the other slaves.\n",
      "<br/>Good night, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Want to go to a real party?\n",
      "<br/>Is okay I put my hand here?\n",
      "<br/>I can't understand you.\n",
      "<br/>I'm going to dance with her now.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>Come on. Come with me.\n",
      "<br/>Jack. Jack, wait.\n",
      "<br/>I can't do this.\n",
      "<br/>We'll have to get a bit closer.\n",
      "<br/>Like this.\n",
      "<br/>You're still my best girl, Cora.\n",
      "<br/>- I don't know the steps.\n",
      "- Me, either. Just go with it.\n",
      "<br/>Don't think.\n",
      "<br/>Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!\n",
      "<br/>Wh at? Wait!\n",
      "<br/>Jack, no.\n",
      "<br/>--Beyond the jurisdiction\n",
      "of the Sherman Act.\n",
      "<br/>That's what Rockefeller said--\n",
      "Supreme Court didn't swallow it.\n",
      "<br/>What? You think\n",
      "a first-class girl can't drink?\n",
      "<br/>Get out of here.\n",
      "<br/>Are you all right?\n",
      "<br/>I'm fine.\n",
      "<br/>Two out of three.\n",
      "<br/>So...\n",
      "<br/>...you think you're tough?\n",
      "<br/>Let's see you do this.\n",
      "<br/>Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.\n",
      "<br/>Jesus!\n",
      "<br/>You okay?\n",
      "<br/>I haven't done that in years.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go.\n",
      "<br/>Coffee, sir?\n",
      "<br/>You didn't come to me last night.\n",
      "<br/>I was tired.\n",
      "<br/>Your exertions below deck\n",
      "were no doubt exhausting.\n",
      "<br/>I see you had\n",
      "that undertaker of a manservant follow me.\n",
      "<br/>You will never behave like that again.\n",
      "<br/>I'm not one of your mill foremen\n",
      "who you can command.\n",
      "<br/>I'm your fiancée.\n",
      "<br/>My fiancée. My fiancée!\n",
      "<br/>Yes, you are! And my wife!\n",
      "<br/>My wife in practice,\n",
      "if not yet by law, so you will honor me!\n",
      "<br/>You will honor me the way\n",
      "a wife honors her husband.\n",
      "<br/>Because I will not be made a fool of.\n",
      "<br/>Is this in any way unclear?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Good. Excuse me.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, Miss Rose.\n",
      "<br/>We had a little accident.\n",
      "<br/>- That's all right.\n",
      "- I'm sorry.\n",
      "<br/>Let me help you.\n",
      "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br/>Tea, Trudy.\n",
      "<br/>You're not to see that boy again.\n",
      "You understand?\n",
      "<br/>Rose, I forbid it.\n",
      "<br/>Stop it, Mother.\n",
      "You'll give yourself a nosebleed.\n",
      "<br/>This is not a game.\n",
      "<br/>Our situation is precarious.\n",
      "You know the money's gone.\n",
      "<br/>Of course I know.\n",
      "You remind me every day.\n",
      "<br/>Your father left us nothing but a legacy\n",
      "of bad debts hidden by a good name.\n",
      "<br/>That name is the only card we have to play.\n",
      "<br/>I don't understand you.\n",
      "<br/>It is a fine match with Hockley.\n",
      "It will ensure our survival.\n",
      "<br/>How can you put this on me?\n",
      "<br/>Why are you being so selfish?\n",
      "<br/>I'm being selfish?\n",
      "<br/>Do you want to see me\n",
      "working as a seamstress?\n",
      "<br/>Is that what you want?\n",
      "<br/>To see our fine things sold at auction?\n",
      "<br/>Our memories scattered?\n",
      "<br/>It's so unfair.\n",
      "<br/>Of course it's unfair.\n",
      "<br/>We're women.\n",
      "<br/>Our choices are never easy.\n",
      "<br/>Protect them by Thy guiding hand\n",
      "<br/>From every peril on the land\n",
      "<br/>O, spirit whom the Father sent\n",
      "<br/>To spread abroad the firmament\n",
      "<br/>O, wind of heaven, by Thy might\n",
      "<br/>Save all who dare the eagle 's ﬂight\n",
      "<br/>And keep them by Thy watchful care...\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>I need to talk to someone.\n",
      "<br/>You're not supposed to be in here.\n",
      "<br/>I was here last night, remember?\n",
      "<br/>No. Now please turn around.\n",
      "<br/>He'll tell you. I just need to talk--\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...\n",
      "<br/>...are still appreciative of your assistance.\n",
      "<br/>They asked me\n",
      "to give you this in gratitude--\n",
      "<br/>I don't want your money.\n",
      "<br/>--And remind you you are\n",
      "in third class and your presence here...\n",
      "<br/>...is no longer appropriate.\n",
      "<br/>Let me speak to Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson\n",
      "returns to where he belongs...\n",
      "<br/>...and that he stays there?\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Come along, you.\n",
      "<br/>Hear us when we cry to Thee\n",
      "<br/>For those in peril on the sea\n",
      "<br/>Why are there two steering wheels?\n",
      "<br/>We use this one near shore.\n",
      "<br/>Excuse me, sir.\n",
      "Another ice warning, from the Noordam.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Sparks.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry.\n",
      "Quite normal for this time of year.\n",
      "<br/>In fact, we're speeding up.\n",
      "I've ordered the last boilers lit.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, son, wind it up tight\n",
      "like I showed you. That's right.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, now let it go.\n",
      "<br/>- It was good, wasn't it?\n",
      "- Quite nice. That's excellent.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Andrews...Forgive me.\n",
      "<br/>I did the sum\n",
      "in my head...\n",
      "<br/>...and with the number of lifeboats\n",
      "times the capacity you mentioned...\n",
      "<br/>Forgive me, but it seems that there are\n",
      "not enough for everyone aboard.\n",
      "<br/>About half, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Rose, you miss nothing,\n",
      "do you?\n",
      "<br/>In fact, I put in these new\n",
      "type davits...\n",
      "<br/>...which can take an extra row\n",
      "of boats inside this one.\n",
      "<br/>But it was thought,\n",
      "by some...\n",
      "<br/>...the deck would look\n",
      "too cluttered.\n",
      "<br/>So, I was overruled.\n",
      "<br/>It's a waste of deck space\n",
      "as it is on an unsinkable ship.\n",
      "<br/>Sleep soundly, young Rose.\n",
      "<br/>I have built you a good ship,\n",
      "strong and true.\n",
      "<br/>She's all the lifeboat\n",
      "you need.\n",
      "<br/>Just keep heading aft. The next\n",
      "stop will be the engine room.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, this is impossible.\n",
      "I can't see you.\n",
      "<br/>- I need to talk to you.\n",
      "- No, Jack. No.\n",
      "<br/>Jack.\n",
      "I'm engaged.\n",
      "<br/>I'm marrying Cal.\n",
      "<br/>I love Cal.\n",
      "<br/>Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...you're no picnic. All right?\n",
      "You're a spoiled little brat even.\n",
      "<br/>But under that, you're the\n",
      "most amazingly, astounding\n",
      "<br/>...wonderful girl...\n",
      "<br/>...woman, that I've ever known.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, I--\n",
      "<br/>No, let me try and get\n",
      "this out. You're ama--\n",
      "<br/>I'm not an idiot.\n",
      "I know how the world works.\n",
      "<br/>I've got ten bucks\n",
      "in my pocket.\n",
      "<br/>I have nothing to offer\n",
      "you and I know that.\n",
      "<br/>I understand.\n",
      "<br/>But I'm too involved now.\n",
      "<br/>You jump, I jump\n",
      "Remember?\n",
      "<br/>I can't turn away without\n",
      "knowing you'll be all right.\n",
      "<br/>That's all that I want.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I'm fine.\n",
      "<br/>I'll be fine. Really.\n",
      "<br/>Really?\n",
      "<br/>I don't think so.\n",
      "<br/>They've got you trapped, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>And you're gonna die if you\n",
      "don't break free.\n",
      "<br/>Maybe not right away...\n",
      "<br/>...because you're strong...\n",
      "<br/>...but sooner or later that\n",
      "fire that I love about you, Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...that fire is gonna\n",
      "burn out.\n",
      "<br/>It's not up to you\n",
      "to save me, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>You're right.\n",
      "<br/>Only you can do that.\n",
      "<br/>I'm going back.\n",
      "<br/>Leave me alone.\n",
      "<br/>Tell Lucile about the disaster\n",
      "you had with the stationers.\n",
      "<br/>Well, of course the invitations\n",
      "had to be sent back, twice.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, my dear.\n",
      "<br/>And the dreadful\n",
      "bridesmaids' gowns.\n",
      "<br/>Let me tell you what an\n",
      "odyssey that has been.\n",
      "<br/>Rose decided she\n",
      "wanted lavender.\n",
      "<br/>She knows I detest the color.\n",
      "<br/>So, she did it only to spite me.\n",
      "<br/>If only you'd come to\n",
      "me sooner.\n",
      "<br/>Ruth saw some of my designs in\n",
      "La Mode Illustrée.\n",
      "<br/>They were for the trousseau of the Duchess\n",
      "of Marlborough's youngest daughter.\n",
      "<br/>They were quite charming.\n",
      "<br/>But, I think you'll agree,\n",
      "my dear, that together...\n",
      "<br/>...we've created something\n",
      "of a phoenix from the ashes.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>I changed my mind.\n",
      "<br/>They said you might be up here.\n",
      "<br/>Give me your hand.\n",
      "<br/>Now close your eyes.\n",
      "<br/>Go on.\n",
      "<br/>Now, step up.\n",
      "<br/>Now, hold onto the railing.\n",
      "<br/>Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "Don't peek.\n",
      "<br/>I'm not.\n",
      "<br/>Now, step up onto the rail.\n",
      "<br/>Hold on. Hold on.\n",
      "<br/>Keep your eyes closed.\n",
      "<br/>Do you trust me?\n",
      "<br/>I trust you.\n",
      "<br/>All right...\n",
      "<br/>---Open your eyes.\n",
      "<br/>I'm flying.\n",
      "<br/>Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Come, Josephine, in my\n",
      "ﬂying machine. Going up...\n",
      "<br/>...she goes. Up she goes.\n",
      "<br/>That was the last time\n",
      "Titanic ever saw daylight.\n",
      "<br/>We're up to dusk the\n",
      "night of the sinking.\n",
      "<br/>6 hours to go.\n",
      "<br/>Incredible. There's Smith and\n",
      "he's standing there and...\n",
      "<br/>...he's got the iceberg warning\n",
      "in his fucking hand...\n",
      "<br/>...excuse me--his hand,\n",
      "and he's ordering more speed.\n",
      "<br/>26 years of experience\n",
      "working against him.\n",
      "<br/>He figures anything big\n",
      "enough to sink, the ship...\n",
      "<br/>...they're gonna see in time to turn.\n",
      "<br/>But the ship's too big\n",
      "with too small a rudder.\n",
      "<br/>Doesn't corner worth a damn.\n",
      "<br/>Everything he knows\n",
      "is wrong.\n",
      "<br/>It's quite proper, I assure you.\n",
      "This is the sitting room.\n",
      "<br/>- Will this light do?\n",
      "- What?\n",
      "<br/>Don't artists need good light?\n",
      "<br/>That is true, but I'm not\n",
      "used to working in...\n",
      "<br/>...such horrible conditions.\n",
      "<br/>Monet!\n",
      "<br/>- Do you know his work?\n",
      "- Of course.\n",
      "<br/>Look at his use of color here.\n",
      "Isn't he great?\n",
      "<br/>I know. It's extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>Cal insists on carting\n",
      "this hideous thing everywhere.\n",
      "<br/>Should we be expecting him\n",
      "any time soon?\n",
      "<br/>Not as long as the cigars\n",
      "and brandy hold out.\n",
      "<br/>That's nice.\n",
      "<br/>What is it,\n",
      "a sapphire?\n",
      "<br/>A diamond.\n",
      "<br/>A very rare diamond.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, I want you to draw me\n",
      "like one of your French girls.\n",
      "<br/>Wearing this.\n",
      "<br/>All right.\n",
      "<br/>Wearing only this.\n",
      "<br/>The last thing I need is another picture of me\n",
      "looking like a porcelain doll.\n",
      "<br/>As a paying customer...\n",
      "<br/>...I expect to get\n",
      "what I want.\n",
      "<br/>Over on the bed\n",
      "...uh, the couch.\n",
      "<br/>Come. Lie down.\n",
      "<br/>- Tell me when it looks right.\n",
      "- Keep that.\n",
      "<br/>Put your arm back\n",
      "the way it was.\n",
      "<br/>Put that other arm up,\n",
      "that hand right by your face there.\n",
      "<br/>Right.\n",
      "<br/>Now, head down.\n",
      "<br/>Eyes to me.\n",
      "Keep them on me.\n",
      "<br/>And try to stay still.\n",
      "<br/>So serious.\n",
      "<br/>I believe you are blushing,\n",
      "Mr. Big Artiste.\n",
      "<br/>I can't imagine\n",
      "Monsieur Monet blushing.\n",
      "<br/>He does landscapes.\n",
      "<br/>- Just relax your face.\n",
      "- Sorry.\n",
      "<br/>No laughing.\n",
      "<br/>My heart was pounding\n",
      "the whole time.\n",
      "<br/>It was the most erotic\n",
      "moment of my life...\n",
      "<br/>...up until then, at least.\n",
      "<br/>So what happened next?\n",
      "<br/>You mean,\n",
      "did we do it?\n",
      "<br/>Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.\n",
      "<br/>Jack was very professional.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>What are you doing?\n",
      "<br/>Will you put this\n",
      "back in the safe for me?\n",
      "<br/>Gentlemen, would you excuse me.\n",
      "<br/>None of the stewards\n",
      "have seen her.\n",
      "<br/>This is absurd.\n",
      "It's a ship.\n",
      "<br/>There's only so many\n",
      "places she could be.\n",
      "<br/>Lovejoy, find her.\n",
      "<br/>- Clear.\n",
      "- Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I don't think I've ever\n",
      "seen such a flat calm.\n",
      "<br/>Like a mill pond.\n",
      "<br/>Not a breath of wind.\n",
      "<br/>It will make the bergs\n",
      "harder to see---\n",
      "<br/>...with no breaking\n",
      "water at the base.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I'm off.\n",
      "<br/>Maintain speed and\n",
      "heading, Mr. Lightoller.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>It's getting cold.\n",
      "You look nice.\n",
      "<br/>Miss Rose?\n",
      "<br/>My drawings!\n",
      "<br/>Come on!\n",
      "<br/>Wait, wait, wait!\n",
      "<br/>Wait, wait, wait!\n",
      "<br/>- Go. Go. Down, down.\n",
      "- Take us down, quickly. Quickly!\n",
      "<br/>Bye.\n",
      "<br/>Sorry.\n",
      "<br/>- Keep going.\n",
      "- Thank you, I've got it.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty tough for\n",
      "a valet, this fella.\n",
      "<br/>Seems more like a cop.\n",
      "<br/>I think he was.\n",
      "<br/>- Oh, shit.\n",
      "- Go!\n",
      "<br/>No, over here!\n",
      "<br/>Quick!\n",
      "<br/>Now what?\n",
      "<br/>Wh at?\n",
      "<br/>More coal for number\n",
      "one, mate.\n",
      "<br/>Hold up? What are you two\n",
      "doing down here?\n",
      "<br/>You shouldn't be down here.\n",
      "<br/>It could be dangerous!\n",
      "<br/>Carry on!\n",
      "<br/>Don't mind us. You're\n",
      "doing a great job!\n",
      "<br/>Keep up the good work!\n",
      "<br/>Look at what we have here, huh?\n",
      "<br/>Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Where to, miss?\n",
      "<br/>To the stars.\n",
      "<br/>You nervous?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Put your hands on me, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>It's bloody cold.\n",
      "<br/>You know, I can smell ice, you know.\n",
      "When it's near.\n",
      "<br/>Bollocks!\n",
      "<br/>Well, I can, all right?\n",
      "<br/>Did you ever find those\n",
      "binoculars for the lookouts?\n",
      "<br/>Haven't seen them\n",
      "since Southampton.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I'll be on\n",
      "my rounds.\n",
      "<br/>Cheerio.\n",
      "<br/>You're trembling.\n",
      "<br/>Don't worry.\n",
      "<br/>I'll be all right.\n",
      "<br/>- They ran down there.\n",
      "- Right.\n",
      "<br/>Anything missing?\n",
      "<br/>I have a better idea.\n",
      "<br/>GOI you!\n",
      "<br/>Did you see those guys' faces?\n",
      "<br/>Did you see them?\n",
      "<br/>When the ship docks...\n",
      "<br/>...I'm getting off with you.\n",
      "<br/>This is crazy.\n",
      "<br/>I know. It doesn't make any sense.\n",
      "<br/>That's why I trust it.\n",
      "<br/>Here, look at this.\n",
      "<br/>Look at that, would you?\n",
      "<br/>They're warmer than we are.\n",
      "<br/>If that's what it takes for us to get warm,\n",
      "I'd rather not.\n",
      "<br/>Bugger me!\n",
      "<br/>Pick up, you bastards!\n",
      "<br/>Is anyone there?!\n",
      "<br/>What do you see?\n",
      "<br/>Iceberg, right ahead!\n",
      "<br/>Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Iceberg ahead!\n",
      "<br/>Hard a' starboard!\n",
      "<br/>Turn! Turn! Srnartly!\n",
      "<br/>Full astern!\n",
      "<br/>Hard over.\n",
      "<br/>Helm's hard over, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Go, lads, go!\n",
      "<br/>Bring that steam down! Bring it down!\n",
      "<br/>Shut all the dampers! Shut them!\n",
      "<br/>Hold it.\n",
      "<br/>Hold it!\n",
      "<br/>Now! Engage reversing engine!\n",
      "<br/>Why ain't they turning?\n",
      "<br/>Is it hard over?!\n",
      "<br/>It is, sir. Hard over.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, come on, come on. Turn.\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>It's going to hit!\n",
      "<br/>Jesus Christ!\n",
      "<br/>Jesus!\n",
      "<br/>Hard to port!\n",
      "<br/>Hard to port!\n",
      "<br/>Get back!\n",
      "<br/>Let's go!\n",
      "<br/>They're closing the doors! Get out!\n",
      "<br/>Get out the door! Go!\n",
      "<br/>Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!\n",
      "<br/>Go! Go!\n",
      "<br/>Out! Out!\n",
      "<br/>Oh, my God.\n",
      "<br/>That was a close shave.\n",
      "<br/>Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!\n",
      "<br/>Note the time. Enter it in the log.\n",
      "<br/>What was that, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br/>An iceberg, sir.\n",
      "<br/>I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close.\n",
      "<br/>I tried to port round it, but--\n",
      "<br/>- Close the watertight doors.\n",
      "- They're closed, sir.\n",
      "<br/>All stop.\n",
      "<br/>Have the carpenter sound the ship.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, let's get the hell out of here!\n",
      "<br/>Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.\n",
      "<br/>That's the shudder you felt.\n",
      "Do you need anything?\n",
      "<br/>No, thank you.\n",
      "<br/>There's talk of an iceberg.\n",
      "<br/>I don't see anything. Do you?\n",
      "<br/>If this is where the rats are going, I am, too.\n",
      "<br/>- You.\n",
      "- There is no emergency.\n",
      "<br/>- There is. I've been robbed.\n",
      "- Get the Master at Arms.\n",
      "<br/>Now, you moron!\n",
      "<br/>Did I miss the fun?\n",
      "<br/>- Did you see what happened?\n",
      "- No- I guess it hit over there-\n",
      "<br/>Boiler room six is flooded eight feet\n",
      "and the mail hold is worse.\n",
      "<br/>- Can you shore up?\n",
      "- Not unless the pumps get ahead.\n",
      "<br/>- Have you seen the mail hold?\n",
      "- It's already underwater.\n",
      "<br/>This is bad.\n",
      "<br/>We should tell Mother and Cal.\n",
      "<br/>I think they're very good, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Don't touch anything.\n",
      "I want the room photographed.\n",
      "<br/>We've been looking for you, miss.\n",
      "<br/>Here we go.\n",
      "<br/>Something serious has happened.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, it has.\n",
      "<br/>Indeed.\n",
      "Two things dear to me have disappeared.\n",
      "<br/>Now that one is back,\n",
      "I know where to find the other. Search him.\n",
      "<br/>- Take your coat off.\n",
      "- Now what?\n",
      "<br/>What are you doing?\n",
      "We're in the middle of an emergency.\n",
      "<br/>- Is this it?\n",
      "- That's it.\n",
      "<br/>This is horseshit!\n",
      "<br/>Don't you believe it.\n",
      "<br/>- He couldn't have.\n",
      "- Easy enough for a professional.\n",
      "<br/>I was with him the entire time.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps he did it while you were putting\n",
      "your clothes back on, dear.\n",
      "<br/>Real slick. They put it in my pocket.\n",
      "<br/>- Shut up.\n",
      "- It isn't even your pocket.\n",
      "<br/>\"Property of A.L. Ryerson.\"\n",
      "<br/>That was reported stolen.\n",
      "<br/>I just borrowed it.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, we have an honest thief.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do this, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Don't believe them. You know it.\n",
      "<br/>Let's go, son.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do it!\n",
      "<br/>There's a good lad. Come on.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do it! You know me!\n",
      "<br/>This is most unfortunate, Captain.\n",
      "<br/>Water fourteen feet above the keel\n",
      "in ten minutes...\n",
      "<br/>...in the forepeak,\n",
      "all three holds and boiler room six.\n",
      "<br/>That's right.\n",
      "<br/>When can we get underway?\n",
      "<br/>That's five compartments.\n",
      "<br/>She can float with four compartments breached,\n",
      "but not five.\n",
      "<br/>Not five. As she goes down,\n",
      "the water will spill...\n",
      "<br/>...over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,\n",
      "one to the next...\n",
      "<br/>...back and back. There's no stopping it.\n",
      "<br/>The pumps.\n",
      "<br/>The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.\n",
      "<br/>As of now, no matter what we do...\n",
      "<br/>...Titanic will founder.\n",
      "<br/>But this ship can't sink.\n",
      "<br/>She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.\n",
      "<br/>And she will.\n",
      "<br/>It's a mathematical certainty.\n",
      "<br/>How much time?\n",
      "<br/>An hour. Two, at most.\n",
      "<br/>How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br/>Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I believe you may get your headlines,\n",
      "Mr. lsmay.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?\n",
      "<br/>Look at me when I'm talking to you!\n",
      "<br/>- Mr. Hockley?\n",
      "- Not now. We're busy.\n",
      "<br/>You've been asked to put on lifebelts\n",
      "and go to the boat deck.\n",
      "<br/>I said, not now.\n",
      "<br/>I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.\n",
      "Dress warmly.\n",
      "<br/>It's quite cold out.\n",
      "<br/>May I suggest topcoats and hats?\n",
      "<br/>This is ridiculous.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry, miss.\n",
      "I'm sure it's just a precaution.\n",
      "<br/>Everybody up! Lifebelts on!\n",
      "<br/>What's he on about?\n",
      "<br/>- Put your lifebelts on!\n",
      "- What is it?\n",
      "<br/>Just put them on.\n",
      "<br/>C.O.D.?\n",
      "<br/>Sir?\n",
      "<br/>That's right, C.O.D. The distress call.\n",
      "That's our position.\n",
      "<br/>Tell whoever responds we're going down\n",
      "and need immediate assistance.\n",
      "<br/>Blimey.\n",
      "<br/>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br/>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br/>Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!\n",
      "<br/>Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft!\n",
      "<br/>Release those ties!\n",
      "<br/>Roll back that cover! Smartly now!\n",
      "<br/>Where are the passengers?\n",
      "<br/>They went inside- Too cold and noisy for them\n",
      "<br/>You there! Get down here\n",
      "and help with these lines!\n",
      "<br/>Care for a drink, sir?\n",
      "<br/>Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed up\n",
      "and now we're cooling our heels.\n",
      "<br/>Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.\n",
      "<br/>Nobody knows what's going on.\n",
      "<br/>Just like the damn English--everything by the book.\n",
      "<br/>No need for language, Mr. Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.\n",
      "I want a cup of tea when I return.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.\n",
      "<br/>Please tell me the truth.\n",
      "<br/>The ship will sink.\n",
      "<br/>You're certain?\n",
      "<br/>In an hour or so, all this\n",
      "will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.\n",
      "<br/>Please, tell only who you must.\n",
      "I don't want to cause a panic.\n",
      "<br/>And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.\n",
      "<br/>You remember what I told you about the boats?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I understand.\n",
      "<br/>Over here, son.\n",
      "<br/>Sir, there's a big mob\n",
      "at the Second Class Purser's office.\n",
      "<br/>Go on. I'll watch him.\n",
      "<br/>Aye. Right.\n",
      "<br/>Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.\n",
      "Full steam for them, sir.\n",
      "<br/>She's the only one responding?\n",
      "<br/>The only one close. They'll be here in four hours.\n",
      "<br/>Four hours?!\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Bride.\n",
      "<br/>My God.\n",
      "<br/>We are swung out and ready, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Hadn't we better get the women and children\n",
      "into the boats?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>Women and children first, yes.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!\n",
      "<br/>Step this way, please. That's right.\n",
      "<br/>Come towards me. Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Good.\n",
      "<br/>For the time being,\n",
      "I require only women and children\n",
      "<br/>Right here.\n",
      "<br/>Like the Captain said,\n",
      "nice and cheery, so there's no panic.\n",
      "<br/>\"Wedding Dance.\"\n",
      "<br/>Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.\n",
      "<br/>Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.\n",
      "<br/>Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around.\n",
      "<br/>It isn't time to go to the boats yet!\n",
      "<br/>Please, stay calm.\n",
      "<br/>Make sure you have your lifebelts on.\n",
      "<br/>Let women and children through to the front.\n",
      "<br/>What are we doing?\n",
      "<br/>Waiting. Once first-class people\n",
      "are in the boats...\n",
      "<br/>...they'll start with us and we want to be ready.\n",
      "<br/>Pushing won't get you out any faster.\n",
      "<br/>Go get help.\n",
      "<br/>Lower it away, left and right together! Steady.\n",
      "<br/>Both sides together! Steady!\n",
      "<br/>Steady!\n",
      "<br/>Steady!\n",
      "<br/>Stop, stop, stop!\n",
      "<br/>Hold the left!\n",
      "<br/>Right side only! Right side only!\n",
      "<br/>Right side!\n",
      "<br/>Hold the left! Right side down!\n",
      "Lower away together!\n",
      "<br/>Steady, lads!\n",
      "<br/>You know, I do believe this ship may sink.\n",
      "<br/>I've been asked to give you\n",
      "this small token of our appreciation.\n",
      "<br/>Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, sister, you heard\n",
      "the man. Into the boat.\n",
      "<br/>Any room for a gentleman,\n",
      "gentlemen?\n",
      "<br/>Only women at this time, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Will the lifeboats be\n",
      "seated according to class?\n",
      "<br/>I hope they're not too crowded.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, Mother, shut up!\n",
      "<br/>Don't you understand?\n",
      "<br/>The water is freezing and\n",
      "there aren't enough boats.\n",
      "<br/>Not enough by half.\n",
      "<br/>Half the people on this\n",
      "ship are going to die.\n",
      "<br/>Not the better half.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, Ruth,\n",
      "get in the boat.\n",
      "<br/>First class seats\n",
      "are right up here.\n",
      "<br/>You know, it's a pity I didn't\n",
      "keep that drawing.\n",
      "<br/>It'll be worth a lot\n",
      "more by morning.\n",
      "<br/>You unimaginable bastard.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, Rose darling.\n",
      "There's plenty of room for you.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>You're next, darling.\n",
      "<br/>Come into the boat, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Come.\n",
      "<br/>Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Get into the boat!\n",
      "<br/>Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Good-bye, Mother.\n",
